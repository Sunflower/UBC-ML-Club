 Intro needs urgent fixing 

The last two sentences in the intro need rewording/or a strong citation:

""""The situation surrounding his assasination continues to be murky, while he reportedly was assasinated by Nation of Islam officials, he also had many enemies in the United States government. It is widely believed that the government also had a role in the assasination.""""

I am no expert on the man but I have checked several reliable sources (E.g. """"Malcolm X""""  Encyclopedia Britannica.  1990 Ed.) and they don't say anything about a government role. I am not saying that the viewpoint is untenable, but I don't think 'widely believed' is correct.

If someone more knowledgeable on the subject doesn't do it in the next day or so then I will (I am hesitant to leap in as I imagine that this article can be controversial).

Also, it's spelt Assassination (unless us Aussies are out of step with the rest of the world on that one – happens occasionally.)

"It is just like synthpop being a precursor to techno. Synthpop is white music whilst Techno is black music. Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too. But who started using 45rpm breakbeat over 4-tofloor is enigma to me personally.

Black music may be considered a 'racial term', therefore i think you'll enjoy more politcorrect one: 'Pop music genre created by black people of African/Carribean (may be also Indian) origin'. I asure, no one here wants it to start any racial war.  82.209.225.33"

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,
 
Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture:
The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer:

YBM Web site:
 http://aeamh.free.fr
Site Voyer:
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis 

I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.

There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.

A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.

The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.

What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.

WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?  

Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.  

I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.

Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.  The supposedly open minded LGBT Wikipedian cliques criticize """"right wing religious"""" people (and by right-wing religious that means anyone who doesn't agree with their extremist views) is actually one of the most close-minded groups on wikipedia, with the least likely chance of actually discussing things (as evidenced here) and least likely to consider others views.   29 June 2005 22:08 (UTC)"""
"SineButt 
I hate you so much."
""":From WP:COMPETENCE...
Where we very often see big controversies, though, is with editors who are disruptive while trying to help. This is where we sometimes see a harmful side effect of our (generally quite useful) notion of assuming good faith. Many editors have focused so much on this that they have come to believe that good faith is all that is required to be a useful contributor. Sadly, this is not the case at all. Competence is required as well. 
Competence is required.  Yet, what can we do when we suspect that competence is lacking?  That entry does not provide any step by step process for allowing us to express our concerns regarding editors who are editing outside their areas of expertise.  So Wikipedia policy clearly states that competence is required...but it doesn't give us anything to do about it.  

When we suspect that an entry has a problem...what do we do about it?  Well...either we fix it or we tag the page so that other people can hopefully fix the problem.  Clearly I believe these two editors have a problem...but what could I do to fix it?  Obviously I spent a lot of time trying to encourage them to look at the reliable sources.  That didn't work...so all I could think to do was """"tag"""" them with an accurate label so that other editors might be alerted to the problem.  

Are there better ways of dealing with problems of incompetence?  There are always better ways to deal with problems.  But so far no other editors have brought any other ways to my attention.  Just because I've """"tagged"""" these two editors as having a problem...in no way, shape or form means that any other editors will do anything about it.  But that's on them.

I'm sorry to be blunt, but this just doesn't fly. Ruddiman's hypothesis is neither here nor there with regard to the cause of recent warming.

"""Hi, I'm . I'd like to personally welcome you and thank you for your contributions thus far. As you probably know, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia collaboratively written entirely by volunteers. If you ever see anything that can be improved—be it correcting a typo or writing a new article—don't be afraid to fix it yourself! Don't worry about making mistakes; one of the many editors will probably notice and quickly correct it. If you have any questions, just place the text {{helpme}} on your talk page, and an administrator will help you shortly. Alternatively, you could join the #wikipedia-en-help IRC channel, where dozens of friendly helpers await. You can find out more about the project here, but I won't bore you with statistics and rules. Just remember to be civil to other editors, to always cite your sources, and to write articles from a neutral point of view, and you should be good to go.

Wikipedia is a huge website; with  articles, it is the single biggest encyclopedia in the world. Additionally, there are thousands of policy and process pages, so it can be a bit overwhelming, even to experienced users. When I was new, I found the Tutorial particularly helpful. You might also want to check out the glossary. This page serves as our library reference desk, where you can ask nearly any question imaginable.

The Featured Articles and Good Article pages are good places to look for some of our most well-written and comprehensive articles. On the other end of the spectrum, we have thousands of articles that require cleanup of some sort, so feel free to help out. In particular, many biographies of living persons need to be sourced properly; while this task can be a bit difficult, it's of a highly important nature.

Have you heard of Ševčenko's law? One hundred and fifty years, or more, of """"serious"""" history and good old Dan's dog is the first to pick this tree. 
From what I understood of it, and it's rather over my head, Mc Carthy has a point. However, it would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater to adopt his dates before anyone else does. It means that every date in a book needs to be Mc Carthy-ised. 
And even then I have very serious doubts about the accuracy of the results. Mc Carthy's method may give accurate AD dates, but I suspect there are problems. Take 763. He's content to put Domnall Midi's death in that year, just as the historians are, but why does AD 763 start with an event dated to 20 November? Fair enough, that could just be a glitch from the compilation, but it could also be that whatever the source was, its years did not start on 1 January or March 25 but instead on 1 September. Adding that to an article would be WP:OR, so we won't do that - we do when it's Bede's years because people have discussed it in print, but this they haven't - but we can take it into consideration here when deciding what to do. 
The Chronicle of Ireland was compiled from lots of sources and it would be a reasonable bet that even if most or nearly all of them started the year on 1 January, some would have done so on 25 December, some on 1 September, and some on 25 March. Even if Mc Carthy's system is perfect, you can only be entirely confident about the year if the event falls between 25 March and 31 August.
If we can date events to within a year either way, that's good, if we can date events in the 7th century to within 2 or 3 years, that's marvellous. If it were me, I'd go with """"historian"""" dates, i.e. what Byrne, Charles-Edwards and the rest say, and add Mc Carthy's corrections in a footnote, which is what is done with Penda of Mercia and other C7th Anglo-Saxons where there is a similar, but smaller, problem.

This is the memo that I meant - by the way my German appears really,really, really bad - the German version appears to be copied from the USA version. Of course this is just one of
many memos between the participants. I note that the memos that you put
forward, however, seem to show that the """"Jewish problem"""" was being
handled in ways other than gas chambers - ie deportation or sterilization
( both rather extreme injustices but not deadly - a little reading
shows that Hitler, Himmler,etc... could be quite squimish about 
killing people (ie the wiki article """"Night and Fog"""" sugggests as much).
There has been attempts to question this memo's provenace, however, this
memo is just one of several that follow the same theme - """"leave the Jewish problem alone, at
least till the war is over"""". If there was any gassing - or any murder of 
Jews - it was being done behind Hitler's back ( and  the backs of any
loyal/ambitious Hitlerites ), a not very plausible scenario, but the one 
the memos would force on believers. 

The memo I meant was:

""""Mr Reich Minister Lammers informed me that the Führer had repeatedly
declared to him that he wants to hear that the Solution of the Jewish
Problem has been postponed until after the war is over. That being so,
the current discussions are of purely theoretical value, in Mr Reich
Minister Lammers' opinion. He will moreover take pains to ensure that,
whatever else happens, no fundamental decisions are taken without his
knowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party.""""
July 1942

Unless some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the 
policy - and I believe all the memos and actions taken by various people 
(ie Himmler,Luther, Morgan, etc ) instead tend to confirm the policy - 
it appears that finding a memo with a Hitler ( ie official ) connection
to the Holocaust is just a dream. ( Irving's $1,000 - or whatever amount - seems safe) I hope this memo can make it into the article - ( he may have been a nasty guy but honestly he was 
probably just a bureaucrat, that seems to be the treatment he 
received after the war by people on the scene). 
Browsing/reading the German language wikipedia - I am not really a good
German reader but correct me if you are - version of this article it
appears they also avoid the relevant memo, but of course they have the
fear of prosecution over their heads. In America our reluctance, at least, isn't legal. 
Finding the Luther memo, it appears this memo is of an even later date. 
It is even more revealing as to what the policy toward Jews was during the war.
All Jews were to be expelled from Europe after the war was over - so it 
appears Hitler was not talking gas chambers,etc quite late in the war. 
Memos of this sort seem to crowd all the Holocaust gassing,etc into a
very small time frame - an impossibly small time frame, probably why the 
memos are ignored by all right thinking people.  

PS I just found out that the Luther memo has a long history. It has been ignored 
since at least the 1970s. I thought this was a relatively recent discovery
by scholars etc - it appears to just be an old unanswerable embarrasment 
to the Holocaust story. Thanks for pushing me to search harder. One of the troubles
with trying to hide or falsify history appears to be that it takes very little work
by very unknowledgeable people ( ie me )  to discover the truth. I found most of the
information that seems more plausible than the """"official"""" story by just hitting ENTER
on more than the the first page of search engine results.

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'"

 Discussion moved from Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who 

I know you're all probably sick to your back teeth of hearing about it, but considering how we have just changed the name of the 1996 television film to Doctor Who (1996) (in my personal opinion, an infinitely better name), why not try to resolve the seemingly never ending debate of whether it is 100,000 BC or An Unearthly Child? Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)
 19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)

Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)  

I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...  

I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these """"newbies"""", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it """"An Unearthly Child"""").  20:39, 9 January 2006

The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   
 I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  

The CBC profile I think used """"Out of the Ashes"""", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  — (talk • contribs) 

The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  

That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006

I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  

It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is """"An Unearthly Child"""". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as """"An Unearthly Child"""" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.  (talk • contribs) 16:39, 11 January 2006"

I reduced the precision in the table, but I wonder if we could reach a consensuos here on these infoboxes. (or should I revert?)

(The speed of light in a vacuum is 299,792,458 metres per second is probably appropriate, but The distance from the Earth to the Sun is 149,014,769 kilometres and The population of Cape Town is 2,968,790 would usually not be, because both values are unstable at that level of precision, and readers are unlikely to care in the context.)

Image use
Hello, concerning the pictures that have been deleted, I'd like to say that I support their inclusion here. They are not in any way sub-standard and for me they enhance the article. I am surprised by the claim that these were not agreed by other editors. Wiki publications encourage collaborative editing and nothing has to be agreed up front in this way.   

This image is clearly a photograph of another photograph, or poster, or leaflet.  Not only that, but its a badly framed snapshot, and is obviously the work of an amateur.  The image description is missing, and I do not believe that """"own work"""" is satisfactory for the source field given my concerns about the image.
MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.  of Doom 
I agree that that's a poor quality image and shouldn't be included in the article.   
Parrot, you still need to inform the image author on commons that you have nominated the image for deletion, also it would help the deletion debate if you could give any reasons for your suspicions.   

Regarding the other two images (right), the County Hall one seems reasonable enough, but the festival one is badly framed. The lens is too zoomed in for my liking.   

The 'Oss picture conveys the feeling of the festival to me, crowded, almost claustrophobic. Would be nice if the editors who originally objectd came here themselves to give their reasons.   
Note that there's also an alternative photo of the festival at File:Red obby oss party 20050502.jpg.   
Which doesn't include an 'Oss.   
No, and I sense that may be important.   

I still fail to see what's so terrible about these pictures. By the way, if you're going to remove pictures, please substitute better ones. That way the article is improved, rather than depleted. 

Going through them:
 The Cornish language one is maybe the worst of the lot, but the reflection on the image is clearly on the """"Rooms"""" banner, not on the photograph. It is difficult to find better images of Cornish language use on Wikimedia. Otherwise we're reduced to road signs which use Cornish place names - and they're really loans into English, rather than proper Cornish language use. Two other options to replace first image are on the right.
 There is no way to frame the """"Obby Oss"""". It takes place amongst large crowds of people, often on old streets. Other than that, I can't see what the big deal is here.
 The County Hall picture is fine as far as I'm concerned. (However, if you wish a better one, there may well be one on Geograph which can be transferred onto Wikimedia.) It's a non-partisan image, and can't be accused of pandering to any political tendency.

""""MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around."""" - If I wished to insult people, I'd use much stronger language! What I object to is the use of deliberately obscure (and dubious)  abbreviations to justify edits, without a decent explanation as to why. Personally I would have preferred some kind of reasoning.

Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called as Variyar Swamigal was born at KangeyaNallur, a small village on the bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore and Katpadi in Vellore District. This province is referred to as Thondai Nadu in Sangam literature.

The 25th August 1906 became auspicious day since it has the glory of being the birth date of our Swamigal. (According to Indian Astrology, it was Saturday 4.37 AM, Sukla Patcham, Sasti thithi, Swathi Nakshatram, Subranama Yogam, Gowlawa Karanam, Thula Rasi Kadaga Lagnam)

 
     Swamy's father Siva Thiru Mallaya Dasa Bhagavathar was well known for his discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited. Hence, he was conferred with the title """"Puranethikasa Paarangathar"""". He established 'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate """"Thirupugazh"""" , the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.

  Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, mother of our Swamigal was a noble, highly discipline calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly towards poor was endless.     The parents of our Swamigal belongs to Veera Saiva Dynasty (Primarily followers of Lord Siva) got 11 children, the fourth child was our swamigal.

 TAB
     The Almighty now and then exposes his greatness for the well being of mankind makes saints to born in this world. In this chain of saints, our Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal came to this world at the beginning of 20th century.Life of Swamigal spread over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.

 
'Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and ideals.  Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his life made men to live as men.

Naturally one may not be talented in all subjects One may possess high knowledge in one matter but least about other.

One may be a good orator but not at all a good author.

One may be good writer but not a good orator. Some may possess in depth knowledge in Sangamliterature, but do not possess any knowledge or interest in literature pertaining to religion.  Even people who are well versed in religious literature may not do well in music.But our Swamigal had enormous and deep knowledge and practice of all these arts and literature. In short he conquered, devotion, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast knowledge of texts.

 TAB
The grand mother of Swamigal lived in Kurnool. There was a great saint known as 'Gurubalam' who possessed many talents (Ashtama Siddies). Out of his power he could turn camphor cubes into golden cubes.One day that grand mother(mother of Swamigal's mother) took her son-in-law MallayaDasar (Swamigal's father) to the said saint Gurubalam to get a golden cube for the her son in law. Saint Gurubalam knew this matter through his spritual thought.He asked """"whether the golden cube which I give last  forever? """"Further he told """"A child is conceived and being grown in the stomach of your daughter Kanagavalli and by the child your entire home will be spread with golden cubes"""". According  to the saints words so born was our Variyar Swamigal.

 
Our Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar taught him education, Literature, grammer, music and instrumental music, particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year of his age.Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric) at his eighth year of age.  At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned scholars.

According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal received upadesam 'Satakkara Mantram' from his father and received upadesam 'Sutchuma Satakkara Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal.Palani Easana Sivachariya Swamigal graced our Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri Then Madam Varadhachariyar.

 
In his early days Swamigal had Dharshan of 'Srimath Pamban Swamigal' . Later once swamigal received Sadakkara Upadesam from Pamban Swamigal in dream. Bhramma Sri Loganatha Iyyer known as Madurai Thirupugazh Swamigal established Thirupugazh Saba at Adi Street"

Jews that feel they can edit against any change from the goyim that doesn't request their prior approval on all Jew-related topics get away with bullying by calling me having anti-Semitism et al.  Who is playing the race card, simply because I noticed them using it like an ACLU card?

[geni's advice on how to win an edit war
Discuss every edit on a talk page. Do not react emotionally. Assume good faith (even when you are pretty sure that the other person is not acting that way). Never revert first. Don 't make or respond to personal attacks. If the other person is trying to make things heated try mediation. Following this lot can result in two outcomes: a. It ends up in arb comm and your case is unasible. b.your opponent adopts these tactics and you end up collaborating on the article.]

If that only solved the loophole problems that exist by manipulating prejudice and other things on here which go unnoticed by all except those accused of vandalism or trolling.  I wish that we didn't have to deal with veiled supremacists, but they always try to achieve your trust.  I really don't look for edit wars and bitch sessions, but when others don't care and/or are oblivious to systemic bias it really pisses me off.  I'm about protesting injustice, with fighting words if that's what it takes to get attention on an issue."
"Finding consensus is frequently impossible when parties refuse to communicate completely. One of the classic problems with consensus communities is that it can take a lot of time to discover the underlying unities, and some don't have the patience for it (or, simply, the time). A few people, in addition, really don't want to find agreement. It, or the process, might whack their agenda upside the head."
"The cite that I supplied on the concubine talk page was to a published decision by the California Court of Appeal. I have now included an expanded version of that reference on the main concubine page.

Thank you for the responses. Obviously I made a couple of mistakes. The version immediately before yours did have some gaps and problems that I overlooked. I guess the sentences, """"The social implication of viewing ageing as a disease could be profound, though this classical is not yet widespread."""" and """" Lepers were a group of afflicted individuals who historically shunned and the term """"leper"""" still evokes social sigma. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomena. Yet not all disease evoke extreme social stigma.""""  made me think you were not a native english speaker because of the multitude of simple number and agreement errors as well as the awkward structure and unusual word use.

I was trying to get rid of the false distinction between disease and syndrome and linkage of symptom to syndrome. A syndrome is simply a combination of problems (not just symptoms in the accurate sense of subjective complaints) often observed together and presumably related. Whether a condition is called Smith disease or Smith syndrome is more a matter of historical contingency than any meaningful denotative distinction. It looked like you were reasserting that and I was trying to get rid of it.

Minor wording issue about steamboats

The thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before 1850, at least to Fort Vancouver. The first was the Beaver (steamship), which arrived at Ft Vancouver in 1836. I thought about rewording the sentence The regular use of steamboats along the river..., but that isn't quite right either because the Beaver was in """"regular use"""", even if its operations were not limited to the river. Anyway, I can't come up with a way to reword this bit, especially given the existence of the footnote, which does not mention the Beaver. So I'm just mentioning it here.

"The problem is not only or perhaps even primarily with companies, but with non profit organizations, and pressure groups of all sorts. The problem is not primarily with skilled PR professionals, but less skilled people assigned to it, or simply amateurs. There's a good deal of COI editing of companies and products done by fans of the products, not by the companies, and some degree of conflict of interest permeates most of Wikipedia. Almost everything I ever worked on is either because I am interested in it, or want to show off my virtuosity. 
And I agree with Dennis that in most cases we might as well deal with COI on the article page directly, as with other edits. King4057, and others, have asked me at times to approve article drafts they have COI with I have refused to do so, because I will not take the responsibility for something I have not written, beyond seeing it is not blatantly objectionable. Let COI editors declare the affiliations, and then their edits will be judged appropriately. The only time that an edit needs approval on a talk p. is when it is dealing with something that is obviously susceptible, such as removing inconvenient facts.   
The true question is the same with this approach as with prohibiting direct COI editing:  how do we deal with COI editing from people who do not declare it. I see only two approaches. One is to have an high index of suspicion for every edit that might be influenced by conflict of interest, in essence abandoning the principle of Assuming Good Faith. The difficulty here is that very few can write material that is truly at a standard of sourcing that is proof against the possibility of bad faithit requires not only that statements be sourced, but being confident that all the sources have been examined and fairly considered and judge in context. Very little in enWP meets that standard. This would require actual research and fact checking at a degree which is beyond our capabilities, and amounting to what is done by the most careful editorial review. This is not work for amateurs.  It is easy to say, that if our standards are sufficiently high COI will not matter, but this  The other approach is to require all editors to be identified. The principle of permitting anonymous editing makes us vulnerable; it is necessary for those working on certain topics, but there it might have to be assured by some confidential mechanism for assigning names. Either approach means a radical change in Wikipedia.    
The only simple approach is the same we have used for other problems: patiently remove the worst of it, and go from there. '''''' ( talk )"

 Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia 

This is somewhat off topic, but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page. Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit.

Had I know it was against the rules to erase one's own talk page, I never would have talked there, since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts (which have embarrassing errors), jokes and so on, which were never intended to be permanent. Anyway, for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success. One of the Sysops here, Mr. Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules, by calling someone: “childish, boorish, pig headed [and] unreasonable” and earlier “an insufferable ninny.” The poor fellow was so overcome by grief & consternation, he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities. (I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)

Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: """"Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens."""" ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.

Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:

. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:

You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.

I hope that is satisfactory.

That goes for you, too, Mr. . . uh, Chihuahua – isn’t it? Bow wow! Ruff! Grrrrr . . . Consider yourself gravely insulted. If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel, but since I am a craven bounder, I would, of course, run away instead of accepting.

Admittedly, I am extremely frustrated with user dcandeto, and my actions have been less than perfect, but I wrote an article for a journalism class on a well known guy named Cody Hedman, and Dcandeto hounded on it until it was deleted.  I felt I did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down.  I admit I made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto.  Firstly, I created Cdub1985 a run off of the guy I wrote about, and then jazzy 006, jazzy 007, and I got my friends to try and keep it on.  Honestly, my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated, and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but I do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about.  Honestly, what I wrote was not a vanity article, and I just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way I was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and I retaliated.

Fastfission, I welcome your thoughts on the article and examples. In defense, here is some reply to the most telling point (and heart of the method) The """"predictions"""" section puts the horse before the cart: Watson had already seen the B-form photograph before they thought of proposing the double helix. In Watson's Double Helix memoir, he clearly states that he and Crick had already worked out the mathematics of the Fourier transform of a Helix as an X-shape. They had come upon it with the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and had already deduced TMV had a spiral shape. At the time of discovery (of structure of DNA) they did not know the orientation of the bases (inside or outside the helix) which Watson deduced by his concrete modelling of the nucleotide pairs. The discovery (of structure of DNA) came after, at least according to Watson's memoir. And Watson is still alive to clarify this for us. It is a golden opportunity for someone to ask and write down so that we can cite. But the article clearly states that scientific method is not linear, as you have well put. It is a horse-race between the steps, some of which can then be linearized after the moment of discovery, for publication. I do not mind the adjective lousy; in Feynman's words English is a lousy language, yet we somehow manage to communicate with it, and those of us who are prisoners of the tongue even attempt to think with it as well.

 your multiple editing practice 

Hi,

The following users have already mentioned this to you: , ,  and .
Your practice of multiple edits for simple changes is distracting to other user's editing of Wikipedia.
You have asked for explanations and have received them:
 It confuses users who are editing the page at the same time as you, as my confusion was when we edited Dayne Beams at the same time and you had only updated his game count and not the stats update time, and therefore I almost added an extra game to him.
 The number of edits a user has is almost meaningless. Nobody looks at this number, and a user's quality isn't judged by the number of edits, but rather by the quality of the edits.
 It floods the watchlist and the recent changes list and makes it harder to spot if other users have made inappropriate edits.
 (adding this one now) Micro-editing takes more time, which you could use for other things, such as bettering a larger number of articles.

We would all very much appreciate if you desist from this practice.

Thanks,

  

 I fully support all four comments. Cheers,   

 Following up from your answer on my talk page, Yes we would like you to do the whole stats change in one edit.

Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization:  The work of this group is interesting, even though I am not myself drawn to join in at this point.  I did ask the following question in the SBS WikiProject talk/forum ... (in anticipation of something we both might want to tackle in the future?):

Exceptions to standardization?  My guess is that there are some plausible and well-informed reasons for those cases in which standardization is not the best choice.  

My question becomes relevant in that context:  Will someone please give me one example in which an understandable interest in standardization was not sufficient to overcome the reasons for a specific non-standard succession box?  One would hope that there would have been more than one illustrative example ...?  

I understand your question to be, 'Are there examples where the standard succession box is not the best choice.'  There is a long-standing disagreement about which article should be linked to from U.S. representative's boxes (discussion here: Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox) .  For example, should New Hampshire representatives' boxes link to United States Congressional Delegations from New Hampshire or List of United States Representatives from New Hampshire?  I happen to like the former, since all of these articles for all of the states are fully populated.  Another editor very much would like it to be the latter, expecting the articles to become populated once many articles link to them.  If the Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox gets changed, I was contemplating creating an alternate standard for some states, which admittedly wouldn't be ideal. 

Standardization of succession boxes is something we try to do to fit all needs.  Quite often we find exceptions to the rule, but when that occurs, we either bring it up here to discuss, or find some easy and manageable solution that attempts to correct it.  Personally, I have run across numerous templates that are not in this series and cannot easily be corrected to work with it.  In those cases, I try to convert everything I can in the code and leave or customize the rest to work with the format established.  This was everything that has been standardized is standardized, leaving only the code that we currently have no standards for.  As you can tell from the templates page, there are many templates in this series and many that are not.  Some of the members including myself are attempting to remove as many of the older (and often very complex) templates to this simpler format.  However, some templates such as those for the Canadian parliament are not even undergoing review currently until the current problems are resolved due to their advanced codings.

I hope this somewhat answers your question.  Was there anything specific you were wondering about?– ( Talk • Contributions ) 

I must add that I have myself been removing such templates for quite some time, and have adopted a specific format for both Representatives and Senators, samples of which one can find in the succession boxes for the United States Presidents. My versions look essentially the same as the old ones, with some redundant text having been removed. Link modifications can be performed on these newer, simplified templates much easier, as editing a template is a very different thing indeed from simply editing pages. , The Duke of 

Cut me some slack here, please: I'm the one who initially asked about exceptions to standardization, and now I'm going to try to sketch a bit of the rationale behind that query.  In a way, I hesitated to post any question in the first place for fear of arousing anyone's too eager interest  but now I have no choice but to deal with any unanticipated consequences.  

My concern is focused on pre-Meji Japanese history. I'm persuaded that the succession boxes for Emperors of Japan and Japanese era names are fine the way they are  for now; but they could become better, more useful, more focused ....  

In January 2008, I'd like to begin to work with others in a process of possibly improving the format somewhat, but I'm too wrappe"

He did not take their stores and wealth away from them because he thought they were doing bad with it.  He did so because he thought they were less than him, or damaging his power.

"Now I believe you are done Sophia, congrats.  I will ping User:Ponyo and User:Anthony Bradbury, to see if we need to do anything more, or be told anything more.  
 Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?  
 As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures. 
 Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.  
 I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.  
 But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.  
 Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.  
 On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.  
 This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.  
 She should remember the rules of WP:COI and WP:SPIP, and stick to making suggestions on the article-talkpages or in draftspace, if she ever wishes to see edits made, related to herself or her workplace.  
 Admins, is this advice all correct, and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear, before she goes on her merry way?  And also, I understand that it is customary to let cleansed-usernames tidy up their old userpages and their old usertalkpages, if they wish; can she archive all this info here into the page-edit-history, should she wish?

Re: question posed to Shell about my comments above

Re: a question posed to Shell over on her talk page: I did not say that Shell advised me to delete comments made about the block or the Sept. 5, 2008 AN/I from my current talk page; I said that """"upon the advice of Shell"""", which she made to me, not to continue the discussion of the AN/I on my current talk page, that neither should anyone else be doing that on my current talk page. I explained (in this section) that I would be at first editing out (using < !  /  >) and then deleting any comments made subsequent to the blocking of me by gnangarra/garra. (They are still visible in preview mode so that people who posted them can copy and post them as comments to Shell, e.g., or in a pertinent not closed AN/I, which they are free to re-open if they wish.)
See """"NYScholar issues revisited"""" (archived discussion): instructions are in the top of the archive box; w/ the closing administrator's Gnangarra/garra's Conclusion/Summary.  The directions say that if one wants to engage in """"subsequent"""" discussion of it, one needs to start a new page at WP:AN/I.  My current talk page is not for that kind of discussion.
(cont.) My point: If I can't discuss the AN/I on my talk page, neither can others continue to do so on my talk page. I do not welcome further comments about it (since I am restricted from replying to them by Shell and the current blocking administrator's block), and, therefore, I will delete them.  To continue to place them here, on my talk page, is, in my view, based on what Shell has advised me about my own comments, inappropriate.
(cont.) Re: views about the current block by Gnangarra/garra:  people can contact the blocking administrator Gnangarra/garra directly to comment on the block one way or the other.  But one does need to keep in mind that it is a violation of WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:Etiquette to lobby for blocks of other users who are not engaging in any currently blockable behavior (as I am not).
(cont.) See WP:BLOCK for policy; blocks are not supposed to be punitive; they are supposed to be preventative.  I and Shell have questioned the validity of the current block. Scroll up to unblock request(s).
(cont.) If unsure, people do need to consult the links provided in my #N.B. section above, which will go to policies and guidelines relating to commenting on user talk pages.
(cont.) At Shell's request in the AN/I (at end of archived version), she asks people to contact her directly if they have specific concerns about my editing in Wikipedia done after the closing of the AN/I, as she is currently my mentor and is trying to guide me to have better communications with other Wikipedians in talk pages particularly.  Please see the end of the now-archived closed report via WP:ANI.  Thanks again.    
My current talk page is also not for debating Gnangarra/garra's (in my view and that of Shell) unfounded block of me (my unblock request explains my view of it); if you have your own views about the block, please communicate them on Gnangarra/garra's talk page or on the talk page of the last declining administrator , not on my talk page, but please be mindful of WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:Etiquette, or you yourselves may find yourselves blocked (!).  Lobbying for (or perhaps even against) blocks of me on my talk page (or elsewhere) is, in my view, uncivil and a violation of Wikipedia:Etiquette, and I will delete further such discussions from my current talk page.  I am not currently editing Wikipedia because I am blocked from doing so.  I don't want also to become blocked from my own talk page.  If people make personal comments about me as a contributor, I will consider them potential violations of WP:CIVIL, and I will remove them, as per the policies already linked in my """"N.B."""" section; please read it.  Thank you.   """

Sorry I never got to reply to to the message you left me on my talk page:

""""You can explain your comments all you want, but the fact remains that wikipedia policy dictates that we discuss articles, not users. Make sure you stick to that in the future. Additionally, adding the 'unsourced' tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate. A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources, not 0, as the tag implys.""""

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of """"to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians"""", which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation. Thanks, Talk

 Thanks for helping to lift the veil on Verbal - More questions 

Elonka - I understand that Verbal did not block me, but is it true that he had nothing to do with it? I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user's approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent. I just believe in being clear, in communicating, and in helping people to learn to be better Wikipedia contributors."""""""

There is no real necessity for an argument of numbers, as previously stated.

"Still, it's clear that Wulfila chose a lot of his spelling conventions based on those of Greek. Using 𐌴𐌹 to write a long [iː] was certainly one of those conventions, and another clear example is using 𐌲 to represent [ŋ]. He couldn't have based his choice of 𐌰𐌿 on Greek (because there it was becoming [af] rather than a long vowel), but for 𐌰𐌹 he probably was inspired by Greek. So what sound was αι in the Greek of the time? Was it higher than ε or lower? The page Koine Greek phonology shows that both were in fact homophones and had been already for hundreds of years before. So if he took those two writing conventions from Greek, he did not take their pronunciations as they are different in Gothic. That means that we have to derive the pronunciations of those two vowels from loanwords. What letters does Wulfila use to substitute for η in Greek loanwords? And what about Latin, which he no doubt knew as well? The Latin of the time had ĕ [ɛ] and ē [e], length distinctions were probably disappearing (see Vulgar Latin). So what does Wulfila use for these two Latin sounds?"

"This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.

If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal."

However, you could use the same argument to delete almost everything in the article because many encyclopedias include a description of Jimmu so short it doesn't even cover things like the origins of his name and title and the issue of his historicity. In regards to the consensus of Wikipedia editors, and I'm not referring to Flying Tiger, when Nishidani proposed that in the long run we discuss all aspects of Jimmu's memory from start to finish, including medieval and Tokugawa times, historiography, and popular culture, most users who commented agreed with that even though it's safe to say that no encyclopedias cover these last three things. It's certain that people in Japan made a clear link between Hakko Ichiu and Jimmu and if you had done a less restrictive book search, you would still have found no fewer than 430 English language sources noting this connection, including the reliable sources this article cites like Edwards, Dower, Earhart, Ruoff, and Brownlee. For instance, Emperor Hirohito evidently referred to Jimmu when he said """"It has been the great instruction bequeathed by Our Imperial Foundress (the Sun Goddess) and other Imperial Ancestors that our grand moral obligation should be extended to all directions and the world be unified under one roof."""" As historian James McClain notes """"As every Japanese schoolchild who had read Kokutai no Hongi knew by heart, hakko ichiu meant 'eight cords, one roof' and first appeared in the eighth-century chronicle Nihon Shoki."""" The association between Jimmu and Hakko Ichiu was extensively cultivated in wartime Japan, most scholars are aware of that, and it is highly relevant for Wikipedia purposes. Concerning our four sentences on Hakko Ichiu, for now I'd say we can shorten it to three if necessary, possibly deleting the sentence cited to Bix, but otherwise I see no reason or consensus to trim it back further than that. Frankly, as the article gradually expands there is even more that can be eventually noted here such as perhaps uchiteshi yamamu, the other wartime phrase attributed to Jimmu, or possibly Okawa Shumei's establishment of the Jimmu Society. The resurrection of the Jimmu propaganda machine in modern times does not need to be downplayed for fear of """"completely ignorant anti-Japanese POV-pushers"""". Actually, I think we should try to contact Flying Tiger and let him speak here if we're going to keep on talking about him in those kind of terms.  """
""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

From the point of view of the Italian Fleet, the battle definitely wasn't a """"substantial victory"""" to the Italians in any way. 
However, almost all sources agree that, had the Italian Battleship and Cruisers remained at anchor, or had the Italian ships failed to make contact with the convoy, the British delivery of supplies would be completed according to schedule, namely, before sunrise. This disruption of the Royal Navy plans, along with the damage inflicted upon the escorting units, made the cargo ships an easy prey for the German and Italian torpedo-bombers the morning after the battle. 
The only cargo ship to make Malta undamaged by the bombs was the Talabot, largely overdue from the original timetable. All the other were hit in some degree by axis aircraft BEFORE reaching the harbour (not just Clan Campbell, which means that the Royal Navy was still responsible for the steamers fate), further hampering the escorts effort to disembark the supplies in time. 
So, despite the remarkable skills of the British units to save the merchantment from an attacking Battleship, the naval engagement should be considered a marginal victory to the Italians. 
On the other hand, had the British deceived their enemy or in some way avoid major contact with the Italians and reached La Valetta at dark, yes, the Royal Navy success would be undeniable.

The Lymington Foundation is associated with Spix Macaw, a flagship nearly extinct bird.

It's no secret that I'm not a native english speaker. I'm aware of my limits in handling english language. However I still can't see what would be so """"improper"""" in what I wrote, considering the formulation is exactly what native english speakers could read on a website made by a native english speaker.
Maybe the formulation wasn't clear enough (since someone else corrected it already), but I still don't see it as """"improper"""". This goes back to the difference between a neutral comment on my edits, and a bad-faith attack on my person. I hope you'll remember all this in our future exchanges (because no, I won't """"go away"""" and I predict many more clashes like that).

Concerning the following part of your message...These are things I already talked about weeks ago. Obviously you didn't bother reading what I wrote, and you still haven't read any of the Wikipedia documentation for contributors.
WP is a free and open encyclopedia, that anyone can edit at any time. None of its articles are ever finished, they can always be corrected, or deeply reworked. 
It's not my problem if unappropriate edits were made before I decided to modify the article. There has not been any consensus discussion that had approved your section, but anyway I'll note that even  consensus can change. As you can see, WP is based on flexibility.
And I think I have argued enough, I have explained enough why I considered your section had to be replaced. Honestly, I have not mentionned any personal problem against you or any other questionable motivation, I only remarked that rules had been ignored during the writing of that section, and thus it needed to go.
So, to finish with all that, it is not up to you to decide which article can be edited and which cannot be, or which contributor can edit which article. Because these articles do not belong to you. They belong to Wikipedia, and as I'm a part of Wikipedia, I'm also entitled to modify this article.
You've also the right not to agree with certain edits. In that case, to enforce your opinion, then you need to justify it and to explain what aspect of the rules could prevent a certain edit to be made. However, you do not have the right to prevent edits from being made just because you feel the article belongs to you and that you think your contributions are just perfect and don't need improvement.
You have no right to declare an article closed to further modifications just because you like it the way it is.

What really strikes me in your behavior, is that you actually don't give a damn about the content. Not once since you came to this talk page you bothered to argue about the actual content being discussed, nor tried to show if the rules would allow it. No, what mattered for you was only to find ways to assert your domination on articles. You're not fighting to justify or find qualities in the content, you're just fighting for a right to control articles, to maintain your version as the definite and perfect one, and to prevent people you don't like to touch articles.

This is completely anti-wikipedian. So read No ownership of articles and please stop disrupting WP. If I have to go through a dispute resolution process to make you stop, then I will do it next time you revert me again. 
And as I don't see any content discussion here, I consider this debate finished and I won't waste my time answering your claims of ownership.  """

I am an African American currently residing outside of the States.  I just wanted to write and say """"Thanks DeeCee"""", for your work over at the Black Supremacist page.  I surfed there by accident.  I was shocked to find that Wikipedia has even chosen to include this article.  It is far too long in view of the insignificance of so-called """"Black Supremacy"""" when compared to the massive White Supremacist Movement which is once again taking the entire White World by storm.  (Are you a Black Supremacist, if you are only trying to survive in a nation that overtly practices and tolerates Racist practices such a lynching or segregation?)

So many considered him to be a hero for addressing Black suffering in the Post Slavery Occident.  Yet, that article slanders him viciously, referring to him as an errand boy of the Klu Klux Klan and a friend of White Supremacists.  I have not been able to find any truth in any of these statements, so I deleted them.  So much of the material there appears to be merely conjectured or anecdotal designed to tell ugly tales about African people in general rather than focus on the purported subject at hand.  Yet, on the White Supremacist page, there are no such juicy tidbits to further incite anger and outrage.  There are no tales told period, just the bare bones concerning this virulent hate-inspired movement.  In fact, much has been left out.  The White Supremacist article could have included a number of recent and not so reccent events that would have turned any reader's stomach but the writer keeps it very cut and dry.  Not so on the Black Supremaciy page where, the author goes out of his way to assasinate the character of any Black person who remotely expresses any racial pride or hope for his people.  I guess, he is just two fingers from calling Martin Luther King a Black Supremacist, since he incited Black people to protest white brutality and segregation.

I want to complain to Wikipedia about the unhealthy tone in which the Black Supremacist page has been written.  The assaults on Rappers and other musicians such as Lauren Hill is shocking.  I have no doubt that the article is motived by racial hate.  It is so apt that you have identified the problems as systemic.  Wikipedia is a true menace in the sense that people of African descent are often assaulted but may lack the resources, time or orientations necessary to defend themselves against those who use Wikipedia to commit what amounts to racial assault.  Refutations are highly resented and a general ambiance of White supremacist aggression reigns on many pages.  I haven't read all that you've written, I imagine that you spend a lot of time, fighting the good fight.  Again thanks.  I hope you get this message.Sincerely

(2)I left in the last three paragraphs which you think don't deserve attention, however it is true, and this behavior definitely deserves attention in a """"comments and criticisms"""" section. I think the problem here is that it is not a clean section. The current wording certainly is of an axe grinding nature, but can be cleaned up and sourced to become good information. Here is the original section I've pulled from-
Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted """"comments/criticism"""" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article. Insertion of information regarding Hitler's abuse of drugs after his assasination attempt, or Exxon's treatment of the Valdez incident, and subsequent hand wringing over the suit, to all be examples of pertinent info regarding individuals and companies that can easily be perverted to a non-objective position, but are still highly valuable when done correctly.
So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic.

Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  
I'm also confused by your statement,  was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing logged-in or logged-out? If it was editing logged out, then there's an even more serious problem because it should always need a manual restart after a block.  If it was editing logged-in, then the """"kill switch"""" isn't working.  So, no matter how you look at it, something's not working right.   """

Latest from Sarfatti about the Ira Einhorn case

jpg of CIA Memo of 1963 by Richard Helms on Soviet Paranormal R&D;
and Clandestine Services

""""Most of Ira's book is like reading Casanova, about his erotic exploits with women in Ireland. I have no doubt they are true, but the tales, though entertaining at first quickly grow weary if one is not a teenager or an Oprah addict. They are irrelevant, except to prove that Ira did not smell. Women were attracted to him. He did not smell at all when I met him in 1974.  Ira's understanding of """"free energy"""" and his reference to Tom Bearden are not to my liking because the physics is wrong. However, his connections to the Yugoslavs in 1977 when Holly was murdered, the Shah of Iran's family and many of his political activities made him many powerful enemies with the motive and opportunity to frame him and to weaken the movement he was spearheading. Ira's account of a UFO close encounter rings true. Note Ira's mention of Michael Murphy, Kit Green and Jacques Vallee.

For """"free energy"""" read """"zero point vacuum energy"""". Ira is not a physicist and he was fooled by disinformation agent Colonel Tom Bearden whose claims are worthless. At that time I had not yet figured out the physics of what Ira was after. He was my book agent and I was one of his network of """"300"""" that corresponds also to http://stardrive.org/cartoon/spectra.html

I would not solve the paranormal physics Russian psychotronics weapons problem of DCI Richard Helms until the mid 1990's, i.e. the necessity of signal nonlocality from """"two way relation"""" between pilot BIT wave and IT particle """"hidden variable"""" and the consequent replacement of micro-quantum theory with the macro-quantum theory of """"More is different"""" emergent systems.

""":::""""#The one where you add """"and sometimes unfortunately"""". You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of """"brochure speak"""" is """"antagonist speak""""; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is """"weasel"""" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. """"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - """"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000"""".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.  If you don't like the statement that points out the reality of the situation, then we should remove the claim completely.

""""#The wholesale removal of the section on rhythm in the kindergarten. It needed revision, but not removal. I would replace it with something like: """"Waldorf early-childhood pedagogy believes that clear daily and weekly rhythms are essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security. [citation] [reference to the elements of this rhythm] It also believes that both the seasons and festivals relating to the course of the year provide central formative experiences.[citation]"""" This is a huge part of Waldorf's approach to early-childhood education and needs mention.""""  I don't disagree that this is part of the pedagogy, but the wording has to be concise.  """"Essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security"""" - you sound like Donald Rumsfeld with your terrorist scare tactics here.  Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying """"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important""""?  What you wrote above is the type of brochure speech that riddles this article and makes it impossible to view it as other than a advertisement.

""""Others of your edits I have already revised and a middle ground has been found; this process will continue, I would expect. I have not been reverting your edits generally; only blatant editorializing (which I have sometimes managed to convert into something meaningful)."""" Your """"middle ground"""" and mine are in very different places, my friend.  Blatant editorializing is what my edits have been removing.  Just because I haven't had time to go back and re-word what you believe you have made """"meaningful"""" doesn't mean it has any validity in this article.  As long as you, a Waldorf teacher, is here making this article """"meaningful"""" - there will be no end to the controversy here.

""""The tag should go because it is presently unjustified, as you all agree; it is inaccurate in its present form; why are you advocating keeping something that is not accurate? If it becomes accurate, it should go back; that's easy enough to do."""" Nobody agrees - as far as I know, with what you have said above - although one polemic editor besides yourself did remove the tag.  The tag is completely justified.  Here's the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed: 

""""According to Steiner, the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example,[4] so in Waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring, practically active adults to emulate. The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.""""

And there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work.  I'm sorry if it is offensive to you as a Waldorf teacher, to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness.  In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.  There is absolutely no justification for removing the tag while this type of language fills the article.  There was, at one time, a promise of a re-write of the article (most of which, I belie"

 Gyroscopic Inertial Thrusters 

Interesting discussion. The greatest hindrance to discovery and invention is MENTAL INERTIA, and the treatment of science as though it is a dogmatic religion.
 
Can anyone cite an authority that made the ridiculous statement that angular accelerations and momentum can NOT be exchanged for linear accelerations and momentum?
 
Such claims were made by Edison, attempting to discredit Tesla's alternating current. Mass and momentum equations are remarkably similar to the math involving electronics.
 
Over 20 others repeated my experiments, converting angular accelerations into linear acceleration, passing pendulum, water, ice skid, and air table tests.
 
Conservation of energy is NOT violated, since energy is required to change the velocity or direction of the device.  While only small """"anomalous"""" amounts of thrust have been generated, the venemous nature of religion in the name of science has been VERY difficult to overcome.
 
""""Do NOT confuse me with facts and experiments that appear to violate a BASIC TENNANT of physics, it is IMPOSSIBLE, therefore I will disbelieve my lying eyes!"""" - is the too common reaction when any attempt is made to further this field of research.

""" issues, because these ones are unlikely to be resolved through discussion, and are usually very demanding on the MC members.

However, issues between users, such as Wik, Theresa, 172, VV etc... are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.

It seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. Arbitration is about punishment, mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. It is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. And it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution, which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations, threats, insults and generally speaking attacks between users, as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists. 

I have a problem with this. The MC basically finds itself plagued by trolls, and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. So, how useful is the mediation committee ? 

I'd like to mention something. In real life, people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. This cost is in particular that
 arbitration is a long process
 arbitration is costly
 arbitration is sometimes unfair

I wonder if any arbitration on Wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. Apart from very specific cases of troll handling, most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. If arbitration was more costly, perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first, before heading to punishement. Perhaps should they be a cost, whatever the outcome ? Perhaps should the decision taken by the AC more costly in case there was refusal to discuss ? 

I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include:
 Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult.
 To be effective, mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  Real-world mediators are retired judges, former statesmen, former heads of corporations.  They are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion, and balance.  The parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  The committee at present includes some members not known for this.  Moreover, Wikipedians as a rule do not extend """"unimpeachable respect"""" to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here).
 Mediation requests are presently public.  They should not be (c.f. MeatBall:GetARoom), since it leads to playing to the court.
 Process is """"not yet fully decided"""" (Wikipedia:Mediation Committee), which discourages people who could, potentially, be helped; indeed, the mediation-releated pages have an unfinished, essay-like feel to them overall.
 Some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (GetARoom again), since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a MeatBall:fishbowl.  The WP community should get over its """"all discussions public and archived forever"""" fetish, which is disfunctional.  Consider the success of the IRC channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ML).
 There are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (""""Mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate, and how to mediate.""""  Wikipedia:Mediation Committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (""""You will then have to agree both on a mediator,"""" """"The mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation,""""
 It may be necessary to send some people to mediation.  I can think of several cases where contributors could, appropriately, be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  Lots of real-world success with this.
 We have a problem with some articles where carefully-crafted compromises are undone by editors who weren't involved in the original compromise, which prevents healing.  I know of no good way around this, but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.

It would be nice to have a single page to discuss changes relating to all the Unicode chart templates.

However, I don't see any reason not to capitalize """"reserved"""", """"control"""" and """"not a character"""" to """"Reserved"""", """"Control"""" and """"Not a character"""" on Wikipedia when used as titles.  You could also make a case for capitalizing character names rather than using all upper case (e.g. """"Latin Capital Letter A"""" or """"Latin capital letter A"""" instead of """"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A"""", but in very many cases it would be problematic to decide which words to capitalize and which not, so I would prefer to stick with all upper case character names.

You know, I've just been having this discussion on my talk page.  interesting.  What we currently have on project is a kind of pre-tribal band system, which can look like any other system (because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present 'in the bud' in social bands). There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.  Aristocracy in any sense of the term would be a superior system; in Aristotle's sense it would be far superior.  

I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of consensus systems (I live for deliberative democracy…), but consensus systems are hard: they take a lot of self-reflection, a lot of self-moderation, and both a willingness and an ability to set aside small personal concerns in favor of large public concerns.  These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.

 """"September 11 denial"""", whatever that may mean, has nothing to do with Mr Ahmadinejad! Please care to search on e.g. YouTube (see, let us say, this page) and notice that there are Americans who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing """"security reasons"""" as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever denied September 11 happening, however there are some who question the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film The Ziggurat Goddess (about which here), 2004, with Shahab Hosseini in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed.

"""I can't offer an offical document either, that the classical language category was introduced by a constitutional decree, but there are many notifications, that are not published on the internet, like the official notification, that Tamil was declared """"Classical language"""". However, there are newspaper reports, which confirm, that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree. So this is enough to prove it:

http://www.deccanherald.com/CONTENT/Aug142008/editpage2008081384442.asp

Also i found a conversation of the Indian parliament, which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for India, where Mr. Shivraj V. Patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages:

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, the demand for declaring Kannada as a classical language is pending before the Government since 2004. The same answer has been given earlier also. My submission before the House is that the Kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 BC. The first Kannada literary work Kavirajamarga was created in 850 AD and it refers to some writings earlier than that. The 12th Centaury Kannada Bhakti Movement in the form of Vachana or oral expression is unparallel. In contemporary kirtana which subsequently became Karnataka Sangeet is an enduring contribution to Indian music. Sir, the epigraphical material in Kannada, numbering over 25,000 inscriptions in stone and copper, are rich in style and contents, which are not found even in Tamil inscription. The UNESCO records Kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world. Sir, Kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like Hebrew, Chinese and Tamil.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY (CONTD): Sir, the recognition was given to Tamil. We do not grudge it. Now, Sir, when the world recognises Kannada, in India...

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, put your question.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: ...step-motherly treatment is being given to Karnataka. Agitations are going on in Karnataka. About three days back, about one lakh people gathered. Everyday, it is going on. Has the Government recognised this? Is the Government going to take any action on this, and by what time?

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: Sir, Kannada is a very rich language, ancient language. The matter is before the Committee of Linguistic Experts
constituted by the Ministry of Culture. This matter is now with the Ministry of Culture. They are looking into the matter. There are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language. Now, these demands are being looked into by the Expert Committee, and after the Expert Committee comes to any conclusion, the Ministry of Culture will take a decision in the matter.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: Sir, in reply to Unstarred Question No. 1381, it was stated, """"The Ministry of Culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring Kannada as classical language. A Committee of Linguistic Experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status. This Committee will advise the Government in the matter."""" This answer was given on 6.3.2006. Subsequently, to me also, the Minister of Culture has replied saying that it has been referred. Now, the question before the House is as to how long it will go on like this. There is a limit to the patience of the people also. They are losing their patience. You may not believe, but they are condemning and criticising the Parliamentarians and saying that Karnataka M.P.'s are dormant; they are inactive.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI JANARDHANA POOJARY: How long will the Government take a decision? After being referred to the Expert Committee, there has been a lapse of one year, what action is going to be taken by the Government?

MR. CHAIRMAN: Mr. Poojary, this is a supplementary question. Please, ask the question. Don't make a statement.

SHRI SHIVRAJ V. PATIL: As a matter of fact, this question should have been sent to the Ministry of Culture. But, because, the notice was given to us, and the notice was given at the last moment, the question was accepted and we are replying to it. As a matter of fact, it is only the Ministry of Culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this, and I would like to say that the language should unit; language should not divide. Many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division. So, it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the States that on the basis of language, division should not be created. Because the languages are rich; because the languages are ancient; because...(Interruptions).
