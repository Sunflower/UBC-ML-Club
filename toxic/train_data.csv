You appear to be engaged in an edit war with one or more editors according to your reverts at Constitution of Massachusetts. Although repeatedly reverting or undoing another editor's contributions may seem necessary to protect your preferred version of a page, on Wikipedia this is usually seen as obstructing the normal editing process, and often creates animosity between editors.

""" 2005 (UTC)

To say that """"Britain headed the Commonwealth"""" is simply wrong and it represents a misunderstand of what the Commonwealth was and is. onec again: Britain and the Dominions (or later Commonwealth realms) were considered to be equals in the Commonwealth (whereas British India, in 1939, and the crown colonies were not). Hence the Dominions declared war independently of Britain in 1939 (and the Irish Free State, which was a Dominion at the time, remained neutral). Britain is not even a """"first among equals"""". That is the difference between the Commonwealth of Nations and the British Empire. In fact, for most of the war, the vast majority of Australian forces served under Douglas MacArthur in the South West Pacific Area, rather than under British commanders anywhere else. 

Similarly it is a misrepresentation to say that the United States """"ran"""" the Kuomintang. In fact, the Americans — whose forces were technically under Chiang Kai Shek when they served in China — found it very hard to get Chiang to fight the Japanese as much as they would have liked, since he was more concerned with stockpiling weapons and materiel to fight the communists.

In short, I think the division into the Big 3 and subordinate allies is historically incorrect.

 This is the last time I am going to tell you: Stop vandalising and stop disturbing me 

Family names are a valid article. Each family name in every language can be an article. Instead of your Serbophobic (and therefore racist, since you are apparently Korean, at least that is what you claim) vandalism edits, go and do something useful like making wiki articles for Korean family names. Most certainly do not ever again take the liberty to tell me what to do, because you have neither right nor authority to do that and your snotty and inappropriate comments are unwelcome.

Eventually, as I have already replied at the ludicrous discussion you started  where, BTW, no one took your side  I will create longer pages for each individual family name when I have time. They will be full articles in their own right. For now, leave the Serbian family names alone and do not input vandalism redirects to specific people. People are people and they have their own article and names are names and they have their own articles AS NAMES, not as incidental necessity for redirection. 

Further your comparison with the family name """"Hitler"""" is absolutely abhorrent, as all people who had that family name have changed it after WW II, so that family name does indeed relate to only a signe person. And even so, it would still be possible to write an article about the family name as such, but it's not my interest, so I won't do it. However, writing such an article would be legitimate and such an article could exist as a wikipedia article.

On the links that you have been posting on my page (and which I am going to delete, because they are unnecessary on may talk page) it says VERY CLEARLY: """"MAY"""" and NOT """"MUST"""". Are you really incapable of comprehending the difference between the two? If you are, stop editing Wikipedia altogether because all your edits are likely to be violation of rules.

And, I repeat: do not come to scribble nonsense on my wall again. I have nothing to tell you that I haven't told you three times already and I do not want your inconsequential silly musings on my wall. Go away!!

 Mass Deletions and synopsis 

At this point I think it is important to discuss what constitutes """"excessive detail"""" when it comes to a multi-issue cross-over event. Given that the storyline covers months of details and multiple points of view (each seperate series), we should come to a consensus on what should be included in the article and what should be left to the imagination or primary sources. There also seems to be an effort on the parts of some editors to delete material without consensus, so this is an attempt to find that consensus. Please chime in on your views of the organization, structure, and content of the article.  """,0
"When it comes to obscurity, you need to refer to groups that moniter it. The scientific community depends on skeptical organizations to do that work.

In my work as an astronomer I get reams of letters describing crackpot idea after crackpot idea. I don't have time to respond to each and every one of them. There are only a few people that spend time dealing with such issues. Phil Plait is one of them, Ned Wright is another, but theirs is a hobby  not a full time endeavor.

The fact is that most people in astronomy or cosmology who have heard about these ideas dismiss them out-of-hand. The few that do criticize them do so rather handily  often without looking back even though the Against the Mainstreamers continue to retort and comeback with crazier and more shrill ideas. Even the plasma cosmology proponents get in on the act  Eric Lerner has literally shouted down people at conferences. Scientists have better things to publish than criticism of Halton Arp's work.

So that's where we stand  the references are by ommission and by way of obscure attacks in the literature. We report all crackpot ideas in Wikipedia, but fairness dictates that we call them what they are.",0
"Franklin D. Roosevelt was said to have been quite the charmer in his time. Mainly in the way he talked and ability to make people listen to him, some examples can be seen in sources of him on television and radio. It's said that though Hitler himself was a great person of charm, Roosevelt was the same, however not to the levels of the dictator. Roosevelt was the greater man and applied it with good terms, unlike Hitler. Also I heard how Adolf was the first to use a plane to travel while promoting himself politically, as with adoption of surrounding the area of where he talked with speakers. Maybe this would have contributed to the alluring of Hitler to the German people?

Your contributed article, Protestant revolt
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Protestant revolt. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - The Reformation. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at The Reformation - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

This is a """"one-issue account"""" with a suspiciously good knowledge of Wikipedia rules and jargon for a new account owner - and after just three hours since account creation already has a history of disruptive editing, a 3RR violation and a resulting admin block.

The account has only ever been used for editing Stanley Meyers' fuel cell and Admiral Sir Anthony Griffin (who was a strong supporter of Meyers' and whose article was just created by this user by highly dubious """"close paraphrasing"""" of a copyrighted web page).

It was encouraged at the time to simply find articles that you thought were """"good"""", and slap the article with it (as you put it) to get the idea up and running. The instructions at the time simply read """"The process by which articles are designated as 'good' should be much simpler and quicker than that by which articles become featured. Simply add any articles here that match the criteria, and add  to the top of the articles' talk pages."""" The criteria have been more formalized since then.

I agree with your statements and the reverts. I would like to add some different thoughts.
I prefer incremental addition of material, because it ensures a proper peer-review process. Adding 60kb on a single day is just too much to control. 
The sudden addition of long paragraphs also raises the question where this material comes from. Of course, the editor might be extremely gifted and produce an unbelievable amount of information in almost no time. But suspicions that the material is copy-pasted are not too far fetched, I think. Especially, when seeing that the style differs drastically between different section (e.g., the way references are coded).

 Antibiotic vs. antiviral drugs 

My purpose to remove the use of antibiotics for """"dual infection"""" is to reduce confusion and not foment the popular misconception of using abtibiotics to treat viral infections. I am aware that the """"dual infection"""" mentioned in this article implicitly referred to bacterial pneumoniae + flu virus, however, one can not expect a casual reader to know that or to understand that the word pneumoniae could be a pathology or a bacteria, especially without the article explaining this and while the article is focused on a virus.
If somebody feels the compelling need to compare treatments of viral pneumonia with a bacterial pneumonia, Fungal pneumonia, Parasitic pneumonia co-infection, please explain so in the apropriate section or article and remark that the use of antibiotics by itself is not effective against any virus, especially the H1N1.

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden. Also, it contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.",0

Etiquette
Your statement """"I keep my conviction that I'm on the truth: that you two are members of some racist organization"""" on this edit directed toward User:Dark Tichondrias  is an accusation that two users are racists, making it against Wikipedia's policy on etiquette.  Wikipedia's policy on etiquette suggests to not accuse other users of being racist. 
WP:Wikiettiquete says:
Terms like """"racist,"""" """"sexist"""" or even """"poorly written"""" make people defensive. This makes it hard to discuss articles productively. If you have to criticize, you must do it in a polite and constructive manner.
This seems to be the issue of dispute. Yet racism is at the heart of this discussion, specially because DT and Thulean are percieved by all the rest as people with such an agenda. 
I'm pondering to start a project called WP:Honesty: Say things clear (without falling in insults), don't hide in word games, don't make threats that make no sense (bravados), don't edit capriciously ignoring the discussion, etc. Play fair and demand others to do the same. 
You pretend that I'm making ad hominem attacks, yet I'm just pointing out who's misbehaving and why. Something that is obvious to all, including you two.
If you would be even minimally sincere you would not be trying to corner me against arbitrarily selected Wikipolicies but you would have protested your innocence, first of all. You are just playing legalism.
If you want me to refrain from denouncing your behaviour and your agenda the least your could do is to  is to protest your innocence, to explain your reasons, to pretend at least that you are not racist. But you only make attacks ad hominem against my honesty and sincerity.

I am not making any personal attacks. I honestly think you are a nazi (or close equivalent, if you want to dwell in the small letter and word twists). You haven't even bothered in denying it, so why should I think otherwise. 
If you think that stating that is a personal attack, please say why. I don't think that openly declaring the (apparent) truth is any personal attack but just that: stating facts, so we can discuss honestly.
What is being discussed in that article's talk page is largely ideological and some people of certain ideology (you and DarkTichondrias) are trying to manipulate the participative process of Wikipedia in your favor, editing ignoring the consensus. I honestly believe it is my duty to fight such behaviour and defend the neutrality of Wikipedia. And I will do it.

My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.   

I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on.

 I see that you found the report on WP:ANI.  The solicitation of warned/blocked users to use their IPs to revert my edits is almost amusing, if it weren't disruptive to others.  However, I'm certainly not going to let a troll/group of trolls keep me from contributing to the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia, nor deter me from reverting vandalism and blocking vandals.  Just a bump in the road.  Thanks for your diligence and for answering TonyTheTiger.  That info was helpful — and I won't make the effort to add this group of edits to a checkuser request.

Your request for rollback

Hi JohnSRoberts99.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.

 Image question 

An image you uploaded back in October 2009 commons:File:Population density of Ireland map2002.svg to the commons does not provide a source of where the data actually came from. I am reviewing all the images in the Ireland article for a future GA nomination and wonder if you recall the source location. It says that it is """"Based upon Republic of Ireland - 2002 Census results"""" but finding the exact source is difficult and where did the Northern Ireland information came from. Cheers   
Republic: Central Statistics Office 
Northern: Office for National Statistics    

I don't mean to be a pedant but the Irish census of 2002 does not appear to have any population density statistics. Did I miss them or did you create them from the census and some land mass data? If you did that would that not be synthesis? The Northern Ireland stats do have density figures but these don't coincide with the county boundaries. Can you please explain some more? I would like to keep this image in the Ireland article but as we are trying to get it to GA and possibly FA, such matters as questioned sources tend to be an issue. Thanks in advance. I am watching this page for a while so there is no need to drop me a  note.   
Here is the original source, that I based the map on. . That in turn were supposed to be based on the above two. I assumed it was right and never checked though. In hindsight I probably should have checked. Feel free to remove or change the map.     

Brilliant. I will dig deeper with the source you provided as I like the image and would like to keep it in the article. Thanks again. Cheers   

 Thanks!

 History of citizenship in the United States 

Unfortunately Tomwsulcer has decided to leave the project. FYI please see User talk:Tomwsulcer#Terrorism prevention strategies moved to user space. I had problems with this article, largely because Tomwsulcer was inexperienced and did not write in a NPOV style and had real problems with being unaware of a systemic bias in his writing. The article I moved was well over 150k, so all in all I could see no other quick solution. (See User talk:Tomwsulcer/Terrorism prevention strategies for my conversation on the article with Tomwsulcer)

Because more people have contributed to the article History of citizenship in the United States you might like to open up a discussion on its talk page of what to do with the article now that the principle author has left leaving so many problems behind. I would have thought that the subject is notable and drastic pruning may allow the article to remain. However if the consensus solution needs an administrator to carry out an action let me know.    

 Tomwsulcer also wrote Criticism of American foreign policy, which is even worse, so I've sent it to AfD. At least some of the """"History of citizenship"""" article might be salvageable, although it see",0

Thank you. I've inserted only text from the published sources. Without contravening Wikipedia's policy of no original research, is there a way to mention strange factual discrepancies in the author's work that haven't been cited in published sources...e.g. 'in his book Broadway Babylon Hadleigh has Madeline Kahn say: """"Nathan Lane has a wonderful sensibility for comedy...It does rather surprise me that as a gay man he participates in that degree of homophobic humor in The Producers. They couldn't have known ahead of time that it would be a hit."""" Broadway Babylon, Back Stage Books, 2007 ISBN-10: 0823088308 p289 However, Kahn died in 1999 while Nathan Lane first appeared in The Producers in 2001.

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   """,0

"""Forgetting about the in-depth meaning of the verse 34 in Islam==
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An-Nisa,_34
In the Qur'an, verse 34 of Surah an-Nisa (abbreviated as 4:34) concerns the issue of marital relations in Islam. This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband's wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated """"beat"""" as """"separate"""", as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]

Ibn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush). There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it.[6] Furthermore, Muhammad commented on this verse, where he said “a light tap that leaves no mark.”[7]

You seem to be making arguments against a person who does not exist, because I never edited any article to say that RCOG is """"activist.""""

In the United States, a CNN poll asked the following question in May of 2007: """"With respect to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life?""""  45% said pro-choice and 50% said pro-life.  Do you seriously believe that those 50% are activists or consider themselves activists?  I certainly don't think that.  Those 50% are simply saying what their opinion is.

Regarding RCOG, they may well be """"activist.""""  I don't know, and I don't see how that is the least bit relevant to whether they are """"pro-choice"""" or whether they have taken a """"pro-choice position"""" on some issue.  I suspect RCOG is """"activist"""" on this issue, since they oppose reduction of abortion time limits.  That is a political position, and not merely a matter of complying with existing law.

"I've also looked at Shervink's sources and I find them all to be either biased, inaplicable, or unreliable. In my opinion Shervink is advocating a minority viewpoint. Perhaps he should express within the article and note it as such, but clearly it is not reasonable to expect this view to be represented equally with generally accepted facts. 
I feel that this is mostly a well written and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointless. These events are accepted by most sources to have been a coup. What this means is that Mossadeq is accepted to have been the leader of Iran at the time in question, and to have been deposed. The phrase counter-coup implies that Mossadeq deposed the Shah first, which according to the ample scholarship cited in this article, is not what happened. 
It is of course possible that the concensus of scholarship on this issue is in error, but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition, holders of minority viewpoints. 
That said, I do think Shervink's views are interesting and should be included (and noted as a minority viewpoint) in the article. This issue is generally seen as the west vs. Iran with the shah on the side of the west. A point of view more sympathetic to the monarchy is rarely heard.  Itsafarce",0

God knows how many times this has been brought up, but I can only guess that I'm not the first, nor will be the last. Nonetheless, I'm still a bit unsure on how I feel about Otacon redirecting here.

Thanks for your advice, please remove the Kfir Bomber along with...... which might have killed some thousands in the Civil War.  

 Thanks . I understand your feelings and respect your thoughts and views.Kfir Bomber was there so long time.and Wiki Pedia didnt decide the Kafit Bomber as violence image. Why didnt you ask to move the picture those days? Problem here is not the peace of machine . if you still have problem with Kafir Bomber discuss with United Nations and other relevant authorities .ask them to banned the Kafir bomber ,F16 and other all the War Planes around the world. this all planes do same thing.    
I haven't visited for a long time Sri Lanka page and didn't give enough notice to the Kfir Bomber. 
Kfirs were used to bomb LTTE targets in the North & East of Sri lanka and there were several civilian casualties especially in the last stage of the War. When the victims' kith and kin visit the Sri Lanka page, Kfir won't be a piece of flying machine for them. Again for many it's a Friend of Conquest!      

I have removed both War related images. and will take nessary action to remove all the war related topics.this page is not a United Nations forum.please take those matters to nessary authorities.   

If the War related details are part of the Sri Lanka's history, better let them be there, whether they are debated in the UN or elsewhere.   

Kindly take necessary action to remove all war crimes allegations from the page.  There are war crimes allegations against the US as well.  I don't see  a section on their page dedicated to the subject.  Thank you.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 61.245.172.40   

The argument, the war crimes allegation section is not there in the US page, doesn't validate, it should not be there in the Sri Lanka page.  
The dispute has already been settled.  
Can you show me the link where it is settled.  

Just because there are allegations, it is not justify its addition into a country article. There are many allegations directed at any country at any given point. Yet these are NOT added for the simple reason that they are only allegations, not proven facts. Therefore alleged matters will be taken out of the article and could be included in the primary article of the war.

"Suggested clarifications 

I think Gilles objection to using ports as classification is that it may be confused with the number of valves promoted by post petrol engine manufactures. I suggest usine 'Dual cycle' instead of 'four port' and 'Single cycle' instead of 'two port'.

The avec chariots ans sans chariots designs could be used in either layout. The AC would be better suited to an internal combution engine but would also suit say an gas pump or expander, due to the greater change in volume through the cycle. 

The possible use as an internal combustion engine has recieved the most attention. It has many more uses - pneumatic motor, steam engine, refrigerant expander, pump etc. As far as I can see development is currently focused on the 'dual cycle', which is better suited to the majority of these uses, so perhaps the 'internal comustion engine' should be presented as a simply possible use of the single cycle configuration.

Photo-detonation/HCCI/SCCI/ATAC really warrant a seperate page with a mention here that the Quasiturbine is better suited to it than current engine designs due to the quick compression rate at 'tdc'

It is theoretically possible to use different fluids in the pump, as long as cross-contamination is not a problem. You could use hydrolic oil to pump air, as long as it doesn't matter if your compressed air is full of hydrolic oil! The fact the rotor is exposed to both 'cycles', there will be a layer or oil on the face plate when it is on the 'air' side. Seals and tolerances would also have to be right for the 'thinner' fluid, meaning an increase in friction compared to puming a thicker fluid.

Unjustified protection of an article

Vocabulary: (1)a language user's knowledge of words. (2)the system of techniques or symbols serving as a means of expression (as in arts or crafts); """"he introduced a wide vocabulary of techniques. (3)a listing of the words used in some enterprise

Lastly, IMDB reports that The Blind Side (2009) has thus far been released only in the USA and Canada... hardly a true worldwide release.   """,0

So, if Middle Germany is """"misleading"""", and Central Germany is """"really wrong"""", what can we call it? -   

""""Middle Germany"""" is a germanism

Hi everyone,I turned this into a disambiguation page, with a new page for the economic & cultural region called """"central Germany"""" (Saxony(-Anhalt) & Thuringia), so please link accordingly. The German Wikipedia isn't arranged that way, but this isn't the German Wikipedia.

Also, I don't want to be dogmatic against the phrase """"Middle Germany"""" (I won't change this or this), but in English it's not common to describe central areas as """"Middle"""". The only other examples I could think of were Middle Earth and the Middle East (so-called because it's midway to the Far East), and apparently Middle Congo (Moyen-Congo) existed from c1903-1910.

For the paragraph:

Some judges are also known to rule against precedent on principle. A judge (or even an interim appeal court) may rule against a precedent that is outdated. The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.

Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled """"The War"""". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video """"Straight Outta Compton"""" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like """"Dark People"""" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. """"I'm So Gangsta"""" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar's look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don't cheat yourself I'm so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled """"Jack London’s Square"""". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties.

Crank_(person)...""""Crank"""" is a pejorative term for a person who 
holds some belief which the vast majority of his contemporaries would consider false, 
is eccentric, especially one who is unduly zealous,
is bad-tempered.
The term implies that 
a """"cranky"""" belief is so wildly at variance with some commonly accepted truth as to be ludicrous,
and arguing with the crank is useless, because he will invariably dismiss all evidence or arguments which contradict his cranky belief.

Common synonyms for """"crank"""" include kook and crackpot.  The word quack is usually reserved for someone who promotes a medical remedy or practice that they know to be ineffective. The crank differs from the fanatic in that the subject of the fanatic's obsession is not necessarily widely regarded as wrong, or a """"fringe"""" belief....   """,0

Hi Bishonen, 

Actually, the """"wink-wink, you know exactly what I'm talking about"""" was directed to Jossi, not you.  My questions to you were about the other quotes of Rawats.  I'm very discouraged to hear you say that you find them too ambiguous to know just who he was talking about.  He was Guru Maharaj Ji.  He was the Perfect Master.  He Was God incarnated, Saviour of Mankind and so on.  In fact, Jossi still thinks he's all of that.  If you would please spend just a little time reading the section of EPO or the Gallery of quotes I linked you to earlier, you'd see this in spades.

Anyway, Jossi is a liar through and through.  He knows full well that Rawat was referring to himself. I mean, really, who else do you think he might have been talking about?

I'm very, very frustrated as you can tell.  I'm a lawyer.  Words and logic are my stock in trade.  Plus I was in this stupid cult for years.  I know it inside out.

Thank you for your reply. 

About my message and your reply: this is my third message if you notice to your previous messages, the first one, I have written you few month ago also.

Number of photos: Somehow you are right there is no standard to the number of the photos per article in Wikipedia. Yes there are a lot of photos in Moscow and other famous cities' article also but it is only Tabriz that has a tag on is header. Also the number of the photos for this cities are proportional to their text.  

Some of the photos are belong to attraction of other cities of East Azerbaijan Province (Marand, Jolfa and ...) That could be involved inside their own articles not Tabriz.

There are some photos from the same monument that shows the same thing, where the monument has its own article and these photos can be presented in the original article and may be one photo in Tabriz article is enough.

Another thing is that we wanna to create a beautiful  article for Tabriz not Moscow or anywhere else.

About my photos: The images that you have mentioned belong to more than one year ago. Also there were not taken with a high resolution camera but quality of some of them are still good in comparison with newly uploaded photos it is the reason that they could survive up to now yet. By the way I have never reduced the resolution of the photos by myself as some users doing. Actually in those times there was no one other photo so at least even photos  with low resolution were better than nothing. 

Your edition: during your previous edition you undid the section about: Capital of Iran, modification in references, sister city and the box at the end of the article.

As a final point I think that we are in the same boat and both of us are about making a good article for Tabriz so may be our contribution together helps to having a better article.-User talk:M_karzarj",0

 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

Hei, 
Sorry I didn’t respond earlier. Was through all the material on using  and the time got away. Only had time to run a quick experiment with ‘’cite webb’’ before going out to meet Herr Professor Omberg for breakfast, and then on to do what must be done for the day. But, now that there is time to write, this is what I understand: 

 Using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent 

 And apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends “rides a robot” to identify new “cite web” templates and makes sure that they go into WebCite to request a permanent archive. 

Somehow – should the link rot, as it undoubtedly will sooner of later – someone will know how to retrieve the reference from WebCite and repoint the reference so it is still live

Notability of Chelsea Heinze

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

Notice
This article focuses on the military campaign, while the American Revolution covers the origins of the war, as well as other social and political issues.

Please try to keep this article at a reasonable length. The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the general reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of war strategies, battle casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions.

Instead of adding additional detail to this lengthy article, consider adding your information to an article on a specific battle, or to one of these campaign articles currently in development. Additionally, one campaign, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga (box at right), does not yet have an article specifically about those operations. Perhaps you will start it Miguel!

NPOV

Reading this article it looks like the US won the war solo, with some assistance (which was mostly inept) from some other countries, one of which happened to be France.  This is evident in the introduction and throughout the article.  The introduction is particularly blatant, mentioning non-American intervention only as an after thought.  Should the WWI and WWII articles mention American intervention as an afterthought too? Am I the only one to think this is a problem?   

I have edited the intro so that it is less laughable.    
I agree especially Yorktown   

Casualties
I think that the casualty figures in this article are incorrect, as 25,000 Americans died in all, and 24,000 British and their allies.

==Americans naturally fickle and disloyal in 2008==

For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, """"Vṛndāvana-bhajana."""" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.
Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:
""""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."""" 
How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»

Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:

«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Prabhupāda is here in ADVANCED AGE of 63 starting to write his Bhaktivedanta Purports – I guess in India it was an advanced age, but not in Florida.

Canadian charts are not the same as Billboard charts
The Canadian Singles Chart is based on CD single sales and nothing more. The Canadian BDS Airplay Chart is a very well-known chart because it's one of the only radio charts that does not use """"recurrent play"""" to remove songs, which means that """"Promiscuous"""" could re-enter in ten years' time. I'm surprised that Canadian charts are being treated exactly like Billboard charts, but they are very different; for example, the Canadian Dance Chart is not as well known as the airplay chart, but it's still in the article. This is likely because it's being used in the same way, but that's not right. Here it was claimed that non-Canadians should not include the airplay chart if their single did enter the Canadian Singles Chart. However, because it's clearly notable (and because Furtado is Canadian), it's use here is appropriate.  """,0

 Youtube link

Certainly, youtube raises some Napster-like issues, but it seems to be a lot more acceptable to the big media outlets, so I really have to wonder if adding a youtube link raises copyright violation issues for Wikipedia.

Rather, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB states that """"Web-specific content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:""""

"Bill2Phone deletion 

I am unsure why you thought this was blatant advertising g11.

1. The article was product neutral except for the title. With respect to that, all players in this payment space use the words bill to phone
2. There are multiple players providing this kind of payment which means there is an industry that is of value being discussed. The article mentions the multiple players in this industry which means it isn't advertising but informative.
3. Bill2Phone is like paypal and paypal is deemed acceptable.  I would only presume it is because of usage or longevity of the product. (see point 4 and 5 to address this)
4. The article focuses on an industry / payment option that has been in place for 23 years, but is not addressed elsewhere in the wiki thereby making it valuable
5. The industry is in the billions of dollars cleared and settled which makes is significant
6. There were many industry references leading to the history
7. There was no blatant discussion as to benefits of this payment type over other payment types or in comparison to the competition. Therefore there was no blatant advertising.

Hello. I noticed you list yourself as a Senior Editor III, which requires both 5 years of service and 33,000 edits. X!'s counter, however, reports that you only have a little over 25,000 edits.

I myself am neither in the band, nor a huge fan of the band, so I didn't write this with the intent to advertise.

 One-based numeration 
There's an interesting numeration called One-based numeration, which could be any numeral system that is counted from one, and it's usually compared to the widely used Zero-based numeration. This numeration defines the number ten as single digit, which is written as 0. But I don't think it's very efficient for arithmetic, what do you think about the numeration?

 edits in Jan., 2012 

Thank you for recently updating this article. I hope you continue. This article has had many adverse edits in the past and I try to keep it within Wikipedia's standards.

If a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that """"the sky is blue"""", or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.

Sources should be secondary, meaning at least one level removed from personal experience. Usually, that means an independent third-party reliable source. By contrast, for example, SA's website is a primary source about SA. Self-statements are primary sources. Primary sources are allowed but must be used with greater care and generally should be shunned (except in the External Links section, for example). Try to find secondary sources wherever possible. Part of Wikipedia's standard is at WP:PSTS.

The lede (sometimes spelled """"lead"""") should be a summary of the body of the article, so it doesn't get a reference. Because the lede is a summary, any statement in the lede should essentially be in the body, too, so the reference should be positioned where the body's statement is.

A tendency to write an article like an advertisement sometimes crops up. The recent edits to this article were mild in that regard; I've seen a much more obvious case recently in another article. While this school network has remarkable achievements that should be described, legitimately sourced criticisms also have to be included or preserved. Articles that are too much like ads are subject to severe rewritings or reversions to earlier revisions, often by editors less familiar with the subject.

Ref elements generally follow punctuation. For example, we'd write, """"This is a fact,Source A. and this is another fact.Source B.""""

Images need alt texts, so that people who are blind or visually impaired can have their browsers read aloud information about a picture. The old image also lacked an alt text for a long time and now I've added one (I could have long ago but didn't get to it). If you create a new image and add it, please add an alt text with it.

"Rodaway himself admits that he is not the final opinion on the matter, but the evidence he presents in his book bolsters his argument on Culhwch ac Olwen's dating; the 1100 date favored by Bromwich, et al., was always based on flimsy evidence, anyway. As far as we can tell, the character of Peredur m. Efrawc did not exist prior to Chretien de Troyes writing Perceval, so there can hardly have been a pre-Chretien Peredur tale; the fact that the character's name was drawn from a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth, the earliest MSS of which dates to the mid-13th century century, further supports the argument that Peredur is post-Chretien. Regarding your question about courtly material, I don't really understand your point - obviously a Welsh author familiar with French culture could have incorporated elements from it into a native tale - but that doesn't seem to be the case here, as there is no evidence for a pre-Norman Peredur tale. What we have here is a Welsh author reacting to French Perceval romances and adding in some traditional Welsh motifs to make the story more palatable to a Welsh audience.",0

Please read my comments more carefully before you complain that: . I did not put any words in your mouth because I never said that you wanted to prove that her naturalisation was in 2004. What I said was:  Can you see the difference? I never said that you are trying to prove she was naturalised in 2004. So please stop the false claims. As far as using the passport for her date of birth that's uncontroversial so it may be done. But putting the date of issue of the passport in the article is useless, as Bbb23 said, and is also original research and used to prove a controversial point in a WP:WEASEL way and without using reliable sources WP:RS to make the point.

Somewhat earlier  correctly observed that """"a citation for that formal definition of equality with domain but not codomain could be useful in that discussion"""".  The citation I gave is from Tom Apostol Calculus, page 54, but this is rather old.  Looking in recent literature was very instructive.  The problem is that definitions of function equality in the literature seem rare somehow (not found in about a dozen of recent math and CS books where such a definition could be expected).  Googling on """"function equality"""" or """"equal functions"""" was equally ineffective, but """"functions f and g are equal"""" yields many results (mostly lecture notes).  Some definitions of function equality include codomain equality, some do not. Here are a few that do not include codomain equality, as requested:

http://solitaryroad.com/c303.html
 http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/handouts/25%20Functions.pdf
 http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sgerking/ECO%203401/Chapter%202.ppt
 http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m3000/lecture8a.pdf
 http://www.cse.unl.edu/~cse235/files/Functions.ppt

An interesting subtlety: many of the latter group define a codomain, but do not include it in the definition of function equality.  As Leibniz would say, this means that they do not really consider the codomain as part of the definition of a function.  More subtle: some talk about """"the domain of f"""" but about """"the codomain"""" (without """"of f"""").

A pragmatic observation: authors including a codomain (say Y) in the definition of a function seem to do very little with it, except (i) defining when a function is """"onto"""" instead of """"onto Y"""", (ii) allowing it to restrict flexibility in the way functions can be combined, for instance, by composition.

 Navigational template 

All the other topics have such things. So if there is a """"X and violence"""" article, there is usually a """"criticism of X"""" navigational template. As a sidebar, it does seems a bit pov-ish and non-WP:TOPIC since articles are often in a """"see also"""" type category rather than relating to the article at hand.   

That's my problem with them also. I think we should really get rid of all the criticism sidebars, all except for the the literary, film, etc, ones since criticism in those circles doesn't usually equate to 'very biassed'. It's almost as bad as putting articles on Christian violence under Wikiproject atheism (or vice versa, though I can't see it happening). When I see articles tagged that way I don't need to see anything else to know that somebody or other has a POV to grind and that the article is likely a mess.
  

 Teehan and Dostoevsky 

So the problem here is that we are mixing contemporary academics with great thinkers and writers and also putting Dostoevsky after Teehan when Dostoevsky clearly predated Teehan.  At the core of the problem is the fact that the question of whether Christianity is violent goes back further than Dostoevsky.  Thus, if we are going to use sources that are not from the last half of the 20th century, then we should frame the whole question as a much older debate involving philosophical perspectives such as Dostoevski's.
Note that I am not objecting to including Dostoevski; I'm just saying that we need to put him up against other great thinkers of a similar stature.  I'm thinking that there must be Enlightenment thinkers who would be good representatives of the critical side.

 Website display 

I'm just curious, especially because I've been seeing several editors doing this, but why would you change """"Evanescence.com"""" to """"www.Evanescence.com"""" (as you did here), when the former is a perfectly valid link to their website and is much more visually pleasing? —  (t @ c) 

The infobox doc has the standard format as """"www.example.com"""" and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to www.ev.com so I followed that pattern as well.  Also, as you mentioned, most other pages have the www. on there as well. Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the """"www."""" subdomain, it redirects to it with the """"www."""" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had """"www."""" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to """"www.Evanescence.com"""". I believe that we should follow suit. ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Okay, that's fine. For most any modern website, the """"www"""" is almost completely redundant, and I personally loath such things, but it really makes no difference for our purposes here. The infobox doc makes no sense to me with that """"standard"""", since IIRC http:// and https:// could technically direct viewers to two different websites, so why not require that part as well? Feels like over-standardisation. —  (t @ c) 

I just figure consistency throughout Evanescence is best.  If that's how they advertise themselves, I guess that's how we should.  On the subject of """"www"""", I agree that it's completely redundant.  The only reason it exists seems to be out of habit. lol  It even sounds stupid on radio or TV when people are advertising their sites """"Go to double-you double-you double-you dot ..."""" Got a studder, pal?  I dunno.  It sorta goes with my want to use metric in the united states... but we know THAT will probably never change as a standard either. ah, well. =D ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ 

Indeed! Why oh why can't we just switch to metric? I'm not sure what you mean by """"advertise""""? You mean how the site is presented by the group in other media? I don't really understand how that is relevant to how it should be displayed by anyone else, but all that's irrelevant! D —  (t @ c) """,0

Notice, how again you present a hopelessly goofy claim, user Labongo.  Can you show us one such occasion where what we have been after has been offered to us, in terms of quotes and the related page informaiton ?

No one has asked as an attachment for the Kven text a list of references which disagree with the information offered.  This is the absurd case now.

We need to see where exactly those offered sources agree with the written text offered in the Kven article.  Those sort of pinpointed and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai wants) - quotes and sources are offered in several key points of the Diki Wiki's text.  For us to ask you to understand the difference in that approach is too much to hope for, it appears.  

You appear to be too young for this sort of conversation, it seems safe to state.  

In the case of user Driakko's text that sort of showing of exact book and page information and - importantly user Labongo - exact quotes on those pages from known and credited historians and/or other scientist cannot be provided.

Read the bold text from the above sentence.  That is what is wanted, not what you claim that has been requested !  Please, read what our messages exactly say.  After you have done that, please stop setting words in the mouths of others, and particularly in the mouths of historians in relation to the Kven text. 

Perhaps just for you - and the types of you - it is important to repeat yet one more time:  We have never asked - and we are not asking now, and we shall not ask in the future - a list of related books an/or historians who have written about the topic.  Instead, we are asking for it to be pointed out where exactly those given sources agree with text pushed for Wikipedia.

We are familiar with the sources offered.  They appear to disagree with the text of user Drieakko !

Given that Firefly is proving to be a failure at the box office by the well accepted formula of Movie Cost > Box Office Take, I am suggesting we start formulating a way to add that to the article.  I mention my love of the movie only to avoid the fans who might try to POV push because they don't want to face the awful truth.  I would suggest you take more time to help with the discussion on what should be said here, rather than pull out an unneeded and rather silly soap box.

Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase
First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as """"lessons"""" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.""",0
"Bias

I know this is likely not the first time it has been suggested, but as an open-minded person, I think myth here is a derog term.  Negro is not defined as a derog term either, but how it is used can speak volumes.  To most people, despite it's Webster's defenition, myth means B.S.

I don't disagree in principle with anything you've written above. I would have no problem with a much stricter notability policy that favored importance over other concerns. However, what you or I might prefer takes  or should take  a back seat to what is. And what is does not require so stringent a standard, at least the way I read the current notability standards. In my view, David Boothroyd met these standards  though barely so  even before the minor scandal. After it, I think there's no question he does. While I share your concerns regarding the future of such articles, the article as it currently stands in userspace presents no viable BLP concerns as far as I can tell.
On a tangent, I am actually considering reworking the notability standards in a way that addresses your concerns above as my first Wikipedia-space project. There are so many """"nobodies"""" that have articles currently that I think this is a rather necessary change. As this would be a major shift, I don't plan on working on it on the actual page, but using a sandbox of some sort. Could you advise me as to both the feasibility of taking on such a project, as well as how to creat a draft like CoM's current Boothroyd article? Thanks, Unitanode 16:05""",0

I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account """"bryansee"""" on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:

 The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.
 This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well.
 This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally """"forcedmemefred"""" is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment.
 Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a """"human sacrifice""""; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's """"well"""", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).
 I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.
 And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.
 BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.
 He gives people kittens. """"Kittens"""" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.
 He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.
 He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of """"seeing a doctor/therapist"""" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.
 He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.
 Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and """"truth"""" is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

 Authorship 

Over at the Barack Obama article, there was some discussion of whether his book authorship merited lead position.  I argued (and consensus seems agreed on this), that very brief mention of those best-sellers should be in the lead, particularly since the books have their own article section.

In McCain's case, he is co-author on several books (none seem as prominent in sales-ranking and the like), and there is not a separate section on them.  However, I still wonder whether there's any sentiment that authorship should still get a clause in the lead. ×talk """,0

As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a """" hog and pig"""" in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: """"As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue"""". I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.

YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is """"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body"""" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)

The repitition of """"critique"""" is redundant and reflects poor editing.  I'll start small by allowing the user to derive that the sub-topics under Criticism will be, well ... criticism.

Both """"Scholary"""" and """"Response"""" are also redundant.  This is an encyclopedia, what kinds of criticism does one expect to find under the Criticism section other than scholary criticism?  As well, """"Response"""" adds no value to the user as being influenced or offering critique can *only* be a response.  However, I'll wait before promoting Criticism and Influence up a level.

"""

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

I've been reluctant to touch this article, fearing that I would just be getting involved in a quagmire. However, I don't think I can remain on the sidelines anymore.  T | C """,0

I'm sure you meant """"suspicions"""", so therefore, I am guilty, is that what I'm hearing? What is a """"sockpuppet""""? According to WP, """"A sockpuppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception."""" I am an IP, and prefer to be an IP, because I do not like false identities - like user names. You (as Pinkadelica), Ylee and all others who use names other than their own, are the true """"sockpuppets"""". It allows you to snitch, make false assumptions and claim the sky is falling, all because you will not be held accountable for your mistakes in the real world. What does any of this have to do with SWAT and Charles Whitman? As I pointed out in bold letters above, Swat was created as a result of the Watts Riots of 1965, almost a year before Whitman. That is not to say that Whitman would not be used later for techniques on how to deal with his type of scenario in the future, but Whitman was unknown to John Nelson and Daryl Gates in 1965. The """"notable events"""" mentioned in the paragraph in the article, came after Whitman, but SWAT was fully funded and implemented at those times. Whitman was not a factor in 1965, nor the """"Black Panthers"""", """"SLA"""" or any other SWAT related issues. Is Whitman used by SWAT as a teaching method? I know he is. There are other events that preceeded Whitman, that are taught as well. The reference to SWAT in the Whitman article, is a misplaced reference, created by mis-informed sources.

"==Wikipedia Withdrawal

To Katefan0,

I have come to the conclusion that Wikipedia is no different than any other source of misinformation. My intentions of contributing to the Whitman article was due to my involvement with the officer who killed Whitman and numerous victims, professors, witnesses and news media outlets. But Alas, I find myself, as Gulliver, lost among a few Yahoos whose intentions appear to be to their own speculation and interpretation of Charles Whitman and The University of Texas Tower Tragedy. Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules, in the face of facts and researched knowledge. They are pedantic and callous, and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level; I must now re-elevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking, something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted. I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson; that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject, there are always those who no nothing, willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions. I will take away all my contributions. I realize they will be re-inserted for the Yahoos benefit, but that will be out of my hands! I would wish you good luck, however, you are going to need something much more powerful than luck to ever make this article correct! Subwayjack",0

Its not that virtue ethicists today would accept Aristotle's particular understanding of human nature and, by consequence, his table of virtues- but rather that they are willing to pursue the virtues via an understanding of man qua animal, which MacIntyre rejects.  That is, the project of virtue ethics today is not just the uncovering of one's social roles and an embodiment of the excellences which one's social narrative provides as MacIntyre conceives of it in After Virtue.  Most contemporary virtue ethicists would object to such a socially situated view of human nature and instead favor a return to the Aristotelian project of examining the essential nature of man.  It seems to me that MacIntyre is more important in the development of communitarian philosophy for which his virtue ethics was tailored.

I was rather intrigued by the addition made by 76.191.230.178, """"that on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""", taken from Quigley's """"The Case for Palestine"""" (p. 162). Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):
""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""
Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""
Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""
That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel. In light of this I am deleting the sentence from the article.   """,0

II - What I added: links and references to respective events, some of which were not in the previous version, eg. the 1st naval revolt, Encilhamento, sequential references to the main civilian and military uprisings of that period, as well as the only issues of foreign policy.

 The reasons """", the"""" Why """":
I - The prior narration was not only truncated due to serious gaps related to some of the key events of that time (both internal and external); 
II - but also contained partial references and biased inferences regarding the cause of the events , having even  spurious bibliographic citations """"justifying"""" such inferences.And all this with the difference, between the 2 versions, of only 3 lines...

Peg Entwistle Suicide

In the article it was said that the sign became such a symbol of Hollywood (the film industry, not the town, per se) that Entwistle used it as a symbol in death (slight paraphrase). The article gave the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" as the reference.

I removed the reference and edited the article because the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is simply wrong. The sign did not become a """"symbol"""" of """"Hollywood"""" until after and because of Entwistle's suicide. I am Entwistle's biographer and the research consultant to a documentary titled """"Under the Hollywood Sign,"""" a look at the last 100 years of history of Beachwood Canyon. In extensive interviews for my book, I have discussed the sign and it's meaning with Peg Entwistle's brother Milton. Milton Entwistle was 11 at the time of his sister's death and remembers very well that the sign was only regarded as a billboardit was never, ever regarded as a symbol of """"The Industry,"""" or """"Tinsel Town,"""" or any other term one may use to describe """"Hollywood"""" the film capitol.

The """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" orginazation has repeatedly rebuffed my requests to accuratly portray the details of the sign's meaning at the time Entwistle died. Furthermore, they have completed perverted the facts of Entwisle's life, career, and death even though I sent them many documents showing their errors.

It should also be noted that the """"Hollywood Sign Trust"""" is an orginazation committed to the care and maintenance of the sign, they are not the end-all of its history, and they are most certainly not the experts on the life, career, and death of Peg Entwistle.

Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea
I note that you began this article. However, the SC of PNG is not actually a separately constituted court: like the Full Courts of the Supreme Courts the Australian States and formerly of the Supreme Courts of the Canadian Provinces (before the creation of the provincial Courts of Appeal early in the 20th century), it is an ad hoc tribunal consisting of judges of the National Court who are empanelled from time to time to hear specific appeals and references.

Saul Friedlander states that """"a man above all: Hitler"""" started the process and that it was not """"generated in the machinery of Nazi and SS administration"""". That is quite normal he argues in that direction, given he is an """"intentionalist"""".
The opposite quotes can be found as well 
 Christopher R. Browning, The Path to Genocide: Essays on Launching the Final Solution, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.87 writes 
""""Martin Broszat and Hans Mommsen, however argued that [the mass murder] occured without any specific and comprehensive Hitler decision or order. The system's automatic mechanisms for 'cumulative radicalization' more than Hitler's ideology and leadership explained the origin of the Final Solution""""  
 Gerald Fleming, Hitler and the Final Solution, University of California Press, 1987, p.II writes 
""""It may be tempting to state that each approach has its merits and to seek an synthesis between the two positions. In fact, functionalism, which stresses the dynamics of a system instead of a central role of a leader, fits better in many ways within the mainstream of modern historiography. The image it offers of Nazism is more 'normal', easier to explain: any group can stumble hapharzadly, from step to step, into the most extreme criminal behavior. Responsibility remains obviously; but it is more deluted, more nebulous, because of the very automatism of the process, its outcome unforseeable, and because of the absence of real premeditation as well. Intentionalism at the other hand asserts that the course of action was in some way planned. This latter view gives Hitler a predominant role, but it also implies much greater awareness at various level; whereas functionalism pushed to its logical conclusion, gets very close to denying that Hitler had accurate knowledge of the Final Solution. It leaves most of the operation to subordinates agencies - in a nutshell, to police terror.""""

 Advice 
We cannot display copyright material, even temporarily. The blanking template on the article gives you a link to a temporary page where you can draft a new article. Please note that:
Minor rewording is not enough to avoid a breach of copyright - see Wikipedia:Copy-paste
You will need to establish notability, a requirement to have a Wikipedia article, which is not a matter of opinion but must be demonstrated by showing """"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject."""" Significant means more than just listing-type mentions; reliable excludes Myspace, Facebook, blogs, places where anyone can post anything; independent excludes the subject's own website, affiliated ones and anything based on press releases. The notability standard for academics is explained at WP:Notability (academics).

I have made no """"legal threat"""" to anyone. It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that """"Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project"""" and that Sven had said """"well, I'm going ahead with it"""". Manguard has since said on my talk page, """"you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ..."""". Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making """"legal threats""""; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything """"legal""""? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be """"directors"""" at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of """"gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks"""". I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—""""not mature enough""""—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues.

I agree with most of what you said about Chicago.

As far as Chicago culture being bland compared to the East and West coasts, you're probably right about that too.  But it's not as if people on the east or west coast don't have their criticism about the other coasts' culture as well.  East Coast people tend to think West Coast culture is too fluffy and superficial and West Coast people think the East Coast is too uptight and high-strung.  So I don't think how Chicago/Great Lakes culture is viewed by people on the coasts shoould really have any bearing on whether or not it's a """"coast.""""

Besides, I don't think the purpose is to compare the Great Lakes to the Eastern or Western seaboards.

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Re the above

Regarding your edit . I fail to see how I am responsible for personal attacks when clearly the other editor has been making defamatory statements about my expertise in support of misinformation he has linked to on wikipedia. I consider it a thoroughly proven fact that the page http://www.tenstringguitar.com/tuningsforthe10string.html contains misinformation. No one can honestly claim that """"four"""" is the same as """"eight"""". Though after repeated warnings about the content of this page, Andrewa continued to reference this page and to defend it by claiming that saying """"four"""" is the same as saying """"eight"""" and that this is a non-issue. How convenient. I think your conduct in this matter is unfair (and you've evidently not looked thoroughly into the contents) as I am clearly the one who is defending verifiable facts as stated in music journals by the inventor of the modern 10-string guitar (my teacher's teacher), whereas Andrewa is falsely accusing me of attacking him (where is the evidence? on what grounds?) because I point out that he repeatedly, knowingly links to and defends misinformation.

If there is a case for personal attack, if you can PROVE that Andrewa did not link to false information (this is a contents issue), then do so. Otherwise, please stop making false accusations against me.

"English English vs American English vs ...

In an earlier edit changing petrol to gas, I wrote in the edit comment that I was changing the wording to American English (gas) because that's the standard for this Wikipedia. Another user pointed out that my assertion of an American English standard for this Wikipedia was incorrect according to the Wikipedia Manual of Style. That user is correct. I was unaware of the Manual of Style's position on this, so I read into it. According to the MoS, there is no standard form of English for the English language Wikipedia. Instead, the language that one uses in a given article depends on: 1) the form of English most closely associated with the topic, and 2) the form of English used by the first major contributor to the article. The article should, in any case, adhere to one standard form of English (for example, American English, British English, Canadian English, Indian English, or Australian English)

I'd like to talk about this for a bit, because I think we may have an interesting boundary case in this article that helps further define the MoS policy on how to select the correct English variant for an article.

English language variants and Unimogs
Item 1 above says that the version of English used in an article should be the one most closely aligned with the subject. The Unimog is a German truck, and so one would have a hard time saying that there is a particular form of English closely aligned with the topic, at least when it's spoken of in Germany. The Unimog has an especially weak association with England, as the British military and farm trades did not (as far as I know) make much use of the Unimog, instead heavily prefering the British designed and built Land Rovers. The Unimog was used in many other nations, however, including Switzerland (by the Swiss military) and some nations in Africa and Asia. I am not aware of the modern history of the Unimog outside of Europe, but I know that in the 60s and 70s, when it was at its peak in terms of exposts, it was purchased in these regions for military applications. In Asia and Africa, I am unaware of any particularly strong association between the Unimog and a given variant of English.

There was one market the Unimog was sold in where there was a strong association with a particular variant of English, and that was the United States. Daimler-Benz, through its dealers and representatives, has sold and services Unimogs in the United States for I believe over twenty years. 

To add to American English argument, in recent years, Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler. Chrysler is a US company.

Further, the US company Applied Minds as widely publicized a variant of the Unimog called the Maximog. This Unimog has received press coverage (a Google search turns up articles on this project in the US newsmedia).

I believe that the Unimog sold more units and has a higher profile in the United States than in any other nation where English is the official language, though perhaps Canada could make a claim. I would like to hear whether others feel that the Unimog has a particularly strong association with Britain, Canada, India, Australia, or another country whose version of English is widely recognized?

English language provenance of the article
Item 2 above refers to the version of English used by the first major contribution to the article (excluding stubs).

I wrote the first version of this article in Sept 2002, and I think I could argue that this was a non-stub creation in American English. The article remained unexpanded until 2004, when other editors added content to it. These edits largely retained the American spelling, but (wisely) introduced metric measurements, which I believe are most strongly associated with Unimogs  I would be surprised if a German-engineered vehicle was built in terms of feet and pounds!

Original article should be like this

 

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

 objections to example given; ambiguous and false 

""""The probability of taking data more than two standard deviations from the mean is roughly .05. Six measurements were taken, so the probability that one should be so far from the mean is .05*6 = .3""""

I have several objections to this statement: the first sentence above is true in the case of data from a normal distribution for which the true mean and true variance are known. In general it is not true. Furthermore, in the example given, the observed (estimated) values of these parameters are used. One can't just replace true values of the parameters with the estimated values and expect whatever probabilistic statement one's trying to make to remain true (and not necessarily even """"roughly"""" true as stated, especially for a sample of size 6).

Furthermore, even IF the data are from a normal distribution and IF one does happen to know the parameters' true values (or good estimates thereof), the probabilistic statement made (the second sentence above) is ambiguous and false: the probability that """"one should be so far from the mean"""" (in the exact sense) is in fact zero, since the normal distribution has no point masses. If the event whose probability is meant to be calculated is """"exactly one should be so far or further from the mean"""", then that value is actually , not 0.3 as claimed. Or, the probability that """"at least one should be so far or further from the mean is actually , not 0.3 as claimed.

""":::::From the diffeology article: """"Differentiable manifolds also generalize smoothness. They are normally defined as topological manifolds with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure"""" (emphasis mine).  The point is not whether differentiable manifolds can be defined without an atlas (I already pointed out that they can also be defined with sheaves), but that the classical definition that most mathematicians are still using is the atlas definition. Markus is correct that the choice of an atlas for a topological manifold doesn't matter, but to be a manifold I will contend that it must have some atlas. Defining the sphere as a set of zeroes is implicitly embedding the sphere into another space. It has already been pointed out several times that a topological sphere does not have a unique differentiable manifold structure. How is the differentiable manifold structure induced by the embedding, and (more to the point) how can one understand the corresponding differentiable manifold structure on a topological sphere without mentioning this embedding? Topological spaces are not equipped with embeddings a priori. That a sphere with a differentiable manifold structure has a topological embedding into euclidean space does not at all imply that the differentiable structure was induced by this embedding. -

This situation clearly qualifies.  And WP:RPA says that I can refactor to eliminate the personal attack.  I have done so.  It isn't an edit war.

Hi, Daniel.  I noticed you blocked User:Trunkarchive.

"""confess (even though I agree with the author that abstance doesn't work) this article is very POV, toward a liberal side. 

It's not POV if it's true

Just because there is controversy over a subject does               I LIKE WAFFLES                    not mean that a NPOV gives equal weight to both sides. If all (or nearly all) studies on a subject support one POV (as is clearly the case with abstinence; see Sex Education) , then while we should note that there is a controversy there is no reason not to write the most objectively true statements we can about it.

To say abstinence doesn't work is POV. In fact, studies have suggested that abstinence education does work. Abstinence education, for example, has been successful in Uganda. The Family Research Council has a few studies on this issue. Sure, the FRC is a conservative think tank but that doesn't mean its findings don't have validity or merit.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.20.204.92   

 Law Section needs work 

The section on laws appears to be complete rubbish.  I've attempted to rewrite it to make sense and be somewhat meaningful but it needs references, timeframes etc.  Who says that laws like this only reduce teenage pregnancy by 0.92%?  When did Texas pass its law?  Is it still valid?  What does the Texan law state are the punishments for teen-teen sex?  Give a case history where the punishment was as unequal as this article says.  What has been the effect of this law?

The original section said something about many goverments, states etc trying to pass these laws but they got killed(?) because of something to do with age of concent laws and human rights.  Give specifics.  Cite a Country/other body (and date and preferably leader of government) which tried to pass these laws and what happened.  Where such laws have been repealed give good examples.

Personally I'm tempted to remove the whole Laws section pending something more meaningful being written.  I'd fix the section myself but I don't have any information on what laws have been passed in this regard.

 Abstinence section 

The absitnence section is still suffering badly from POV problems (both before and after an extensive editing in the last two days).  The discussion of the debate about education belongs in Sex education, particullarly as this is very US-centric at the moment and there is a section there for that (it may be broken out to it's own article as well).  I've tried to edit the article on the whole to improve POV, but some help is still greatly needed  

Added UK-specific details
I've added quite a lot of UK stuff to the article: perhaps someone from the US could add some more detail about contrasting US policies? I've tried not to touch the bits about the causes of TP, so I hope the new stuff's not too POV. I've also deleted some stuff about marriage - I couldn't see what it added.  I'm really up for doing some more work on this article, if someone wants to get in touch to discuss some of the issues.   

Under 19
It may seem illogical, but teenage pregnancy is only considered as such if the mother is aged 18 or under at the time of conception, hence """"under 19"""" not """"under 20"""" - government interventions in the UK and elsewhere take this age bracket as the location of the """"social problem"""" to which this article refers.  It's not a copy-editing mistake, so I've reverted the previous change.  I'm also interested in the comment that """"the term used to apply to girls under 13 becoming pregnant"""" - I've never heard it used in this way in the UK, could you enlighten me? Thanks.   

I wish it was 21. I don't think it's possible to be ready for parenthood nowadays at that age, espeically with the rising cost of living. I also think that technically nineTEEN is still a teenager. They are also young adults, but they are still a teen. Most 19 year olds probably won't consider themselves teenagers and THAT is ok, but they are technically still that..a teen.

"World Serpent Distribution 

Hi 

I see my revisions of the WSD page were undone in preference older page.
The information on the current page is full of misinformation and untruths regarding WSD.
The company was never bankrupt and neither were any of the 3 Directors associated with it.
There was never any court case either.
It is a real pity that nearly 10 yeas after WSD closed down, nobody has bothered to check Companies House or the Royal Courts of Justice.

World Serpent: The Carnival is Over

The past and the future

THE PAST (bad trip): As many of you may have heard by now, World Serpent Distribution have ceased trading.

Current 93 and Nurse With Wound, as well as many other groups, have worked with them almost exclusively since 1989. We felt a great closeness with all three of them: Alison Webster, David Gibson and Alan Trench, and they were both our colleagues and our friends. We are very proud of all the work we did together and the beautiful material and editions we issued with and through them.

 B Kobres concedes work of Dr. Rex Curry http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html 

B Kobres has conceded the historical discoveries of Dr. Rex Curry concerning symbolism under the horrid National Socialist German Workers' Party. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  Even after conceding that the information could not be disputed, B Kobres nevertheless indicated his desire to suppress the information in order to maintain the intellectual errors that Kobres has mistakenly perpetuated in his past. A google post also covers the topic at
http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.libertarian/browse_frm/thread/86dd295af96947f6/b4429553f79b3675#b4429553f79b3675

Wikilings do their dirty work anonymously, hiding behind names that do not identify them because they are ashamed to admit who they are and what they do. The practice is so widespread on wikipedia that people like Kobres have inspired and acquired the term """"wikilings"""" and """"wikiling writers"""" as a reference to their bad behavior.  B Kobres deletes valid responses to the personal attacks and kookiness of himself and other """"wikilings""""; but, B Kobres does not delete the personal attacks and kookiness of other wikilings who write with him. Kobres protects the personal attacks and kookiness of wikilings who write with him. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  B Kobres deletes accurate information about the discoveries by Dr. Rex Curry that expose the history of Nazism in the USA.  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  Wikilings delete anything, including even links, to accurate information. They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults. Wikipedia is a completely untrustworthy source of information because it enables wikiling administrators to delete accurate information, but also to ban people who post accurate information, in order to prevent accurate information from being re-posted.""",0

I got rid of this first paragraph for several reasons:
Capitalism is typically and generally defined as an economic system where the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit; investment, pricing, and distribution decisions are privately made rather than instituted by state control, and a free market exists for goods and services.
First, """"typically"""" and """"generally"""" are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.  Any definition with this many problems has to go.    |  Talk  17:42, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)""",0

Responding here to SlimVirgin's point about purging of the archives. That stops people gaining accessed to WMF-held archives of the list, but it does nothing about personal copies of mailing list correspondence kept by individual arbitrators. There are some arbitrators who have been on the committee for years (much longer than I was), and if archives are purged then any personal archives they may hold would be the next logical target. There are ways to make that attack vector less vulnerable, though, and purging the archives would ensure that new arbitrators only have access to what they get while on the committee. So on balance, I think purging of the archives is something that should, and likely will, be done. Trouble is, it looks like it is a bit late now, and it also raises the problem of verifying the leaks. How can you verify that a """"leak"""" is genuine if the mastercopy has been destroyed?

Question about Edit

Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer:

I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. 

As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project.  

""""With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne

""""Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne  14:34, 3 July 2008""""

""""I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne

These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations.  - Arcayne
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak,' ... - Arcayne'''

I trust the Project will be the better, as has Wikipedia in general, with such a confident and industrious Oxonian on board.

Surely Wikipedia, or the Oxford community, have a place for those such as Arcayne, who are able to place 18,000 edits in 22 months as the very public face of Oxford Wikipedians.75.57.205.135  """,0

"Another common theme of the financial 'media' is to claim that Japan is a source of liquidity to the world.  Low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans, and thus, money isn't available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans.  The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations.  Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

Below are some links in reference. So, Mr. Melkonian, eliminated by Azerbaijani Armed Forces in Karabakh, was a terrorist without any doubts.

He is also an official member of the """"You Tube Deletion Committee"""" started by Dmcdeviti.e., has an admitted bias/ego investment in something other than editing this article.  From his current talkpage, you can easily observe that """"Nearly Headless Nick"""" is a close ally, and not constructively for the benefit of Wikipedia, from what I have seenNHN has recently made the bizarrely ludicrous accusation on mumsy's talkpageto Arygiouthat stating any alternate opinions about YT links is """"disruptive."""" He clearly has ZERO idea what """"disruptive"""" means, as on-topic good faith editorial opinions on talkpages are never disruptiveor perhaps he does know and is trying to bully??? NHN, on the other hand, is in fact participating in a project which is disrupting Wikipedia to make a point; has certainly had a decidedly and idiotically disruptive effect on this article, in my experienced judgement.  My feeling is that they can get lost and stay lost, or we can take it to a higher level.  They are not editors of this article, they have categorically refused to engage in discussion on the talkpage of this article while making edits they know are disputed, and they do NOT have consensus on policy pagesconsensus is against them.

 Rydernechvatal

I think you dodge the issues at hand completely. The issue here is the integrity of the online encyclopedia. To place Nechvatal into the field of collage artists, on par with Matisse, is patently disrespectful to this project. There are thousands of artists who do collage, and very few deserve mention on Wikipedia. My brother is an artist but you won't find me putting him all over Wikipedia! He just doesn't have the stature required. That's not a criticism of his work (or of Nechvatal's), it's a statement about what an encyclopedia is for. May I suggest you build Nechvatal a nice MySpace page?

Similarly, to place a 2 page review on Baudrillard alongside the remarks of Susan Sontag is not helpful either. The point of the encyclopedia is not to list every possible thing connected to Baudrillard (in which case Nechvatal's piece would qualify); the point is to discuss and link things which help introduce and illuminate someone at the scale of an encyclopedia. There are thousands of published articles on Baudrillard and very, very few of them have a place on Wikipedia. The same is true of punk visual art and so on and so forth.

You really don't own up to any of this. This is why the charge of pettiness applies well to you: if you truly took responsibility, you would remove your additions and links yourself, rather than ditching this chore to the community. But that's the basic misunderstanding here: Wikipedia is not about individual promotion, by self by fans or by family, it's about a community of people building knowledge in a collaborative way.Dylanfly 

Nechvatal, as a collagist, is discussed in Brandon Taylor's recent book """"Collage"""" published by Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2006, p. 221. Perhaps your brother is in that book as well? Thus I have nothing to own up to.

For the first citation: He has also exhibited in Paris, Cologne, Alalst, Belgium, Lund and Munich and has participated in museum exhibitions around the world.[citation needed]  see the artists CV here for list of exhibitions : http://www.eyewithwings.net/nechvatal/bio/bio.htm

For your 2nd citation for his work being in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.[citation needed] see: http://www.msstate.edu/Fineart_Online/Backissues/Vol_15/faf_v15_n04/text/review03.html

For #3: Art historian Donald Kuspit has written in his essay The Matrix of Sensations that Nechvatal's digital painting demonstrates that """"there are more possibilities of freedom in digital art — that is, the """"mental elements"""" are """"free[r] to enter into various combinations"""" and thus to be manipulated — than in architecture, painting and sculpture.""""[citation needed]

see: http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit8-5-05.asp which is cited in the reference section

 For #4: Frank Popper states in his book From Technological to Virtual Art that Nechvatal's computer virus work is important to the history of art as it has advanced the use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, while defending and preserving the values of formal painting.[citation needed] see: Frank Popper From Technological to Virtual Art, MIT Press, pp. 120-123

This is also cited in the reference section

"China 

Why can't China be considered a state which follows neoliberal policies or for that matter India.  In the case of India its policies are purely neoliberal (privatizations of state assets, deregulation, reduction of tariffs, more foreign ownership) and they have worked.  China's policies are also extremely neoliberal (allowing full repatriation of profits of foreign companies, allowing foreign ownership, privitization of state assets including hospitals schools and telecom companies, reduction of tariffs, stable currency policy, allowing foreign companies to operate with no restrictions whatsoever, allowing foreign investment with few limitations, encouraging private ownership).  The truth is all of China's reforms are strictly neoliberal since they have made it into more of a capitalist country.

Quote """"We use the term ‘Grand Alliance’ or ‘Allies’ to describe an activated military alliance in WW1 that included Japan and Italy, and again use the term ‘Allies’ to describe on group in WW2 that does NOT include Japan and Italy. Not a big deal, except of course you can tell the ‘anti-Japanese’ wikipedia sites here because they do not mention Japan as a member of the ‘Allies’ despite it being and undisputed historical fact by English and Japanese historians. how I see it used in Asian history books""""

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Italy did change sides in WWII and a co-belligerent state supporting the allies established but the RSI was also set up a state in the North, however Japan was NEVER part of the allies in World War II! As for JAPANESE historians and history books – haven’t you heard about Japanese history textbook controversies .  

In WWI, Brazil declared war on Germany in 1917, however there was never any formal alliance signed between Brazil and the Entente, the Triple entente wasn’t even a formal alliance, but an agreement – there was a unity agreement, however that stated that they would not seek a separate peace with Germany. Britain only declared war on Germany after it invaded Belgium and the United States declared war on Germany and Austria Hungary in 1917 yet not on Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. They are called allies because they were ‘’united for a common purpose’’ - the defeat of Germany and or of the Central Powers as a whole, American industrial strength in terms of munitions and armaments also bolstered the British, French and other allies.   
In WWII, the ALLIES were overall fighting a common enemy at one point in time, and had a common purpose. SOME countries declared war yet did not send personnel to fight but assisted in the the allies in economic or other forms(severing relations etc.).       

Allies amd Axis
The Allies were those countries that joined together in an association against Germany then later Italy and Japan and those countries/movements associated with them(the Axis). In the beginning – Britain and it’s Commonwealth/Empire, France etc. and later countries that joined them against these powers including the US and Soviet Union and exiled governments. There were tensions between the powers especially Roosevelt - De Gaulle and Churchill/Roosevelt – Stalin, however there was mutual co-operation in the form of lend lease and other agreements. On January 1 1942 all of the belligerents signed a document called the Declaration by United Nations - the parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with Germany/Japan and the other member of the Axis.
Not all of the countries delcared war on all of the members of the Axis immediately or some not at all – eg.Brazil only declaring war on Japan on 6/61945. Some countries like only declared war on Japan because they entered to late in the war like Chile, other countries like the Norway and Poland declared war on Japan yet they did not contribute forces against Japan. 

A Global War
""""All I am saying is that if we want to portray that period of history accurately, that in the same way we do not include the Finnish Winter War nor the ongoing Chinese Civil War as part of what we call ww2, that we should record there being 2 separate wars: one in the ‘West’(Europe, Mediterranean) and one in the ‘East’(Pacific and East Asia), and therefore 2 separate groups of friends and foes, 2 separate formations of ‘Allies’. Then we also appear more moral historically.""""

""""What I am saying was that the war in Europe and the war in Asia were 2 separate wars. 2 separate groups of alliances. 2 separate military alliances we deliberately, or just simply irresponsibly, confuse by using the same title ‘Allies’ or ‘Grand Alliances’. Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.""""

""""So even today, we use the same title of an alliance to refer to 2 different wars at the very same time, in this case, right next to eachother even. But if you tell a Canadian, German or Hollander etc that they are members of the same ‘coalition’ at war in Iraq, they will take great offense at your ignorance.""""

==Matt Sanchez response, clarifications and demand for apology from Robertissimo

Robertissimo, I beg to differ.  The """"couple of mentions on Fox"""" were full segments on the O'Reilly Factor, a debate on Hannity and Colmes, a full segment on Fox and Friends, a segment on Neil Cavuto and another segment on ABC News, an op-ed in the New York Post and the Marine Corps Post.  I was given the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award principally because I not only defended myself in all these forums, but Iaccording to the award citationupheld a standard of academic freedom in the face of adversity.  I take great issue with your claim of my """" admission in that article that he was also an escort"""".  No such admission was made, i was trying to make a rhetorical comparison between payment for porn as a proxy to a form of prostitution.  I made this point on SEVERAL occasions on the Alan Colmes show.  I was on Alan's show four times.  I take your statement as offensive, cowardly, counter-productive and demand an apology.  I understand that wiki contributors are supposed to be much more subtle in their criticism, however Robertissimosomeone, to my knowledge, that I have never methas shown great disdain for me by publicly calling me a liar, prostitute or worsean imprecise writer.  
If you, Mr Robertissimo hold me in such low regard, why are you interested in contributing to this article?  That's a fair question.  If Mr Robertissimo refuses to apologize, I'd like some advice on how to handle this matter appropriately.  Editors as the faceless Mr Robertissimo should keep in mind that I am a real person and not some """"wiki curiosity"""". 

Robertissimo's comments on the Marine Corps status shows an entire lack of knowledge of these type of procedures, both formal and informal and his assessment is frankly simplistic.  These issues have been discussed ad nauseum, but angry activists still believe they can """"hurt me"""" through this Wikipedia article.  With all due respect to Mr Robertissimo (none of which he has shown me), where did he suddenly come from?    Are we heading back toward editing wars as the dishonest and biased attempt to further their agenda?  Given the history of this article and the number of, frankly, shady characters who have appeared and disappeared on this page, my concerns are merited.  

Out of curiosity, why hasn't any emphasis been placed on """"further investigating"""" the allegations made against me by U-Haul and the Veterans organization? The Marine Corps Times printed the """"allegations"""", but I haven't seen editors on this talk page bringing up that issue.  It is disturbing, distracting and tedious to have to """"defend"""" myself from the likes of character such as Mr. Robertissimo et al...This page was not meant for that purpose and I would like for civility to return.  I fear there has been a further infiltration by former editors who had been resoundingly banned from these pages.  Can anyone comment?
Writing vs. Edits.  I originally cited a comparison between myself and Rich Merritt (who happens to be my neighbor).  I was told the Salon reading audience would not recognize the former pornstar alias USMC Captain Merritt .  The Salon editor, Mark Schone, inserted Jeff Gannon as Mr Gannon is somewhat of a lightrod for the Salon readership's disdain.  I've made this statement before on at least three occasions (please consult the archives).  
In reality, Merritt's story is entirely dissimilar to my own as Merritt was performing in adult films while on active duty. My last film of record was in the winter of '94, nearly a decade before my enlistment in the Marine Corps.  The comparison between myself and Gannon is also passing at best, as Jeff was considered to be a type of interloper/doppleganger with insider knowledge given to him surreptitiously from some shadowy figure/network within the Bush administration or the Republican party.  In my case, there was no doubt of my identity as a Marine, my status as a student at Columbia University, the subsequent changes that were effected in the student and city policy regarding the discrimination of veterans and the specific description of those veterans were all real and documented.  I also had NO inside help or sway with any party or organization, including (unfortunately) the Columbia Milvets organization.  There was never a question that I wrote the articles I wrote, nor was there a hint of some """"higher up"""" working behind the scenes to help me.  There was also never a doubt that I had merited the CPAC Award. I was unanimously elected according to the event's organizers.  I was even congratulated for courage after standing up to the political roasting after unsourced bloggers revealed my past and attempted to link me (rather poorly) with an anti-gay rights agenda.

""""I am not a crook"""" & """"never obstructed justice""""
Text of press conference , extracted version . 

Neither of the above partial and incomplete transcripts contain Nixon's quote, or the question to which he responded.
you can't find it in the official text of http://watergate.info/judiciary/APPI.PDF, or the extrated version, cause it's not there. The House Judiciary Committee which was holding the Watergate hearings, it appears, did feel question's on Nixon's personal finances and taxes returns were not germane to thier proceedings.
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me.  I'm sure there is a transcript out there that contains both the question asked of Nixon, as well as his response, that the 'plumbers' haven't gotten to yet.   7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)

From Facts on File 1973, Volume 33, No. 1719 Oct. 7-13, 1973, pg. 854, 
""""The White House refused to confirm or deny an Oct. 3 report in the Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin that President and Mrs. Nixon paid only $792.81 in federal income taxes for 1970 and $878.03 in 1971""""

From Facts on File 1973, Volume 33, No. 1725 Nov. 18-24, 1973, pg. 964, 
""""The President made the declaration in discussing his personal finances.  The President was asked about a press report he paid $792 in federal income tax in 1970 and $878 in 1971 and whether public officials should disclose their personal finances.""""

Still no transcript of the question above.  Accuracy and POV of the above quotes questionable as well.  """"persoanl?"""" """"Presidnet?"""" """"inbcome?""""
So I am a half blind clutz who can barely type 30 words per minute, nonetheless they are accurate citations that can be found in virtually any public library.
 I didn't mean to demean your typing skills.  I make my fair share of mistakes as well.  My intent was to point out that the above 2 extracts from """"Facts on File"""" do not specifically relay the content of the question to which Nixon was responding when he mentioned never having obstructed justice.  7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)  

""""New York Times article by R. W. Apple, November 17, 1973 

The above cited NYTimes article does not present the question to which Nixon responded.  
You will find this in virtually all press accounts of the event, because the question 'had nothing to do with Watergate.  The best they can do is call it Watergate related, or allied.
 Actually, you are incorrect.  The Post article specifically states that he was responding to Watergate related questions.  Of course he is talking about his personal finances and taxes when he says he has never profited from his position  but that is not the whole quote.  You seem to keep evading discussion on the part where he also denies obstructing justice.  I believe that if we had a transcript of exactly what he is responding to, it would go a long way to clearing things up.  7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)

It does, however, support the fact that the cursory investigations were indeed related to the Watergate investigations: """"After months of torment over the Watergate and allied scandals, the President gave detailed answers to more than a dozen questions.""""''  Further support that Nixon's quote and the Watergate scandal are at least somewhat related can be found in the Washington Post article here:

""""Declaring that """"I am not a crook,"""" President Nixon vigorously defended his record in the Watergate case tonight and said he had never profited from his public service ...

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

As it is a fictional place name, however, any discussion of """"correct"""" spelling/pronunciation is an academic one, at best.""",0

 POV  talk section moved 

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

"Comment on correlation 
The year 140 AD is leap year so if Thoht 1 is July 20 in 139 AD
it is July 19 for the next 3 years, all 4 years claimed as the rise of Sothis.
The year 2773 BC is likewise a Thoth 1 on July 17 whose previous year is July 18.
4241 BC is a July 19 date for Thoth 1.
As for correlation placing Egypt's earliets dates as 2170 BC and 2030 BC and 2001 BC etc;
the date for Thoht 1 is Jan 6 in 2001 BC and the winter solstice.
The wprt name for new year has been used for sothis but also for solstice
and not clear whether winter or summer. Connecting it to Nile flood doesnt help
when the myth of Noah's flood is at winter solstice. Further, if Thot is the 7th month
then Epagum days begin July 5 in 2001 BC so that the July 10 solstice is Pamenot 1 not 6.
Every disagreement in short Genesis has a counterpart application in Egypt.
Example, reunification in year 955. If Flood is year 600, and Noah dies in year 350,
he dies in the year 350 that the Pharaoh was created.
If using a 360-day calendar for those 350 years, then from year 600 it is year 955.
Unification of dynasties 1-5 is then the same year and event for dynasties 6-10.
The 5th being dead in Genesis in year 340, but in LXX in year 768.
The date 1872 BC July 17 is Memphis. But what if its at Fort Quban where
sothis rises on July 10 the solstice during the 12th dynasty. That blows those
who try to trace July 20 back to a Gregorian solstice in 4242 BC.
And at the time of that July 10 date in the year 120 of the 12th dynasty,
let's say 1824 BC July 10 as second month Parmuti 16 (versus 8th month 22)
we have Paopi 16 on Jan 6, so which is the wprt sopken of in record, winter or summer sothic.",0

, can you compare the versions? I find 's version to be extremely bloated. It is faulty in a number of ways:
""""List of feature films"""" has an extraneous column that provides very little useful information; one could easily say in a sentence above it that one studio distributed the first two trilogies and that another started with the latest trilogy.
Poor merging of planned films into the main list of films, because trying to sort by """"Story Order"""" screws up the table badly
""""Reception"""" was stolen wholesale from Star Wars; this redundancy is unnecessary, and the section can be linked to in the """"See also"""" section
Overall, the version suffers from scope creep. Most Star Wars articles are prose-heavy. This list should be a way to simply list the films for readers, especially with the start of anthology films.

"""==Kolyma==
I came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.
There has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.
I found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.
I look forward to hearing from interested parties.
 Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:
 Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)
 Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it's probably ok now, too.
 Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.
 Drawing most of the information from Solzh's Gulag and dissidents' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page's discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is """"evil"""", as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. 
 Furthermore, Solzh's book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70's and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.
Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.  
I appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing.

It then goes on to a long, rambling diatribe about abuse and male prostitution!

"Thanks for the speedy reply and the links. After mining through about 20 or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. There are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as Template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. As I mentioned before I still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit, perhaps in a table form, that can be added too (or removed) as needed rather than a vague catch all description.

For example, after reading the many of the discussions I can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldn't be done alone. Aside from those 2, the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights.

I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other """"big names"""" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

Ian, I am sorry to see this sad state of affairs. I noticed your first revert on karate when I got home from the karate dojo last night and considered dropping you a line about the extent of grappling in karate from my own experience. I was however quite exhausted from doing a lot of grappling and picking myself up off the floor numerous times. In my style, Shotokan, the philosophy is to take out an opponent with one blow (ippon) so as to be ready for any others, but we still train in grappling and escapes quite a lot. The movements in any kata can be interpreted in many ways, from the obvious to very complex applications from apparently simple movements. There is no way of knowing if the ancient masters who composed the classic katas had these in mind.

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Aftab2.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

Bullshit. """"His corkscrew senton finisher hasn't been called the Cancun Tornado"""". Why the fuck would you argue if you don't have your facts straight? Watch iDia de los Dangerous!, I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event. The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesn't matter. For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name. The guys name is Human Tornado and apparently they thought that the move name Cancun Tornado fit his characters name, even though the move wasn't a corkscrew moonsault. PWG has named the move (multiple times) and therefore it should be in the article.

"""
You can't have it both ways. You're either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you're a fansite. Either way, it's not suitable for inclusion. For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won't provide information we don't already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won't be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite.
Further, the two Wikis you mention aren't even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you'd like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest... but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost-media, Lost-tv, for example). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we'd have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP's reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make a list of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP:EL says to proceed.
As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we'd have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren't. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long-term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no """"freebie"""" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception. The same list of reasons I mentioned above for IMDB, including the fact that IMDB is a featured part of the standard TV Infobox, clearly do not apply to these Wikis nor any other site people have been trying to add (Mr. Clucks, 4815162342, etc.)
Finally, I will agree with you that the list of links for all the individual networks is redundant, and should be chopped down or moved to Airdates of Lost as a link for the country/network listed there.  """,0

 David Johnson (footballer born 1976) 

Hi mate, it's odd for me to have to thank you for decimating an article such as you did yesterday to the article on David Johnson (footballer born 1976). Nevertheless, that is what I must do, as I spent most of last night scouring the BBC's archives (using the Wayback machine a hell of a lot along the way) and rewriting the entire page. I wonder if you might take a look at the state of the article as it is now and perhaps give it a new quality rating on the talk page. I was going to do it myself (it's probably up to B-class by now), but I don't feel that's appropriate after I spent the entire night working on it. Cheers. – Jay

I was not going to reply but have changed my mind after you reinstated your comments when it was obvious I had read them and I could not find a reason or policy for your reinstating them onto my talkpage.  

Links 1-5 were appropriate and restrained responses to trolling and inappropriate behaviour on the part of Askolnik. The one you singled out as """"worse"""" was an accurate edit.  

On 6-10 you obviously did not look at the actual edits;  all of them were appropriate edits to articles.  Frankly, I am surprised that non-NPOV edits are  protected by administrators.  Wikistalking has to involve some sort of harassment.  Placing citation requests on POV statements (that could be deleted just because they are unsourced} and making other positive edits is not harassment.

I was even more surprised to see an administrator remove a copyvio template when there is obvious copyright violation (Skeptic's Dictionary).  I didn't say anything about that, either.

Indeed, I have been very patient in the face of inappropriate behaviour on the part of Askolnick and KarlBunker, including inappropriate comments and ganging up together to evade the 3RR rule to prevent articles from being edited.  It is patently unfair for Askolnick and KarlBunker to be allowed to violate Wikpedia policy at will.  It appears that they take exception to any attempt to remove POV from an article if it is their POV.

I am more than surprised that you changed a warning into a block merely because I deleted harassing, unfounded attacks placed on my talk page by Askolnik even after I requested him not to.

It's not as if I'm the first person they've harassed and I'm surprised to see administrative support and tacit approval of their actions. - """,0

 Kiefer Wolfowitz 

If it's true that you have made the """"only if I'm allowed to bring a lighter."""" about Kiefer Wolfowitz (I have no interest whatsoever in going on IRC myself, but the reports that you said this seem reliable), then you are very lucky that this channel is technically off-wiki. Some """"jokes"""" are in such incredibly poor taste and so offensive that they are bound to get a very negative reaction when the subject hears them. 

From WP:NPA#Off-wiki attacks: """"Wikipedia cannot regulate behavior in media not under the control of the Wikimedia Foundation, but personal attacks made elsewhere create doubt about the good faith of an editor's on-wiki actions. Posting personal attacks or defamation off-Wikipedia is harmful to the community and to an editor's relationship with it, especially when such attacks take the form of violating an editor's privacy. Such attacks can be regarded as aggravating factors by administrators and are admissible evidence in the dispute-resolution process, including Arbitration cases.""""

And from Wikipedia:IRC#How is Wikipedia IRC related to Wikipedia?: """"When the channels are used to attack Wikipedians,[...] the resulting atmosphere is very damaging to the project's collaborative relationships.""""

Since the subject of your remark is not able to reply on the IRC channel, he made the wrong decision and replied on-wiki with an unacceptable but understandable reply. As could be predicted, he received a long block while you came of without even a warning (at least here, who knows what has been said on IRC or elsewhere), strengthening the belief that some editors have more rights than others and that admins are free to do as they please.

Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also """"Siryon"""" or """"Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)"""", which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans.

 Mind Pollution and Sin Star votes 

I have to take issue with your count in closing the vote on Mind Pollution. By my count there were, as you said, five votes for deletion — from myself (the nominator), BDAbramson, Mgm, KissL, and DV8 2XL — and only two votes to keep — one from Factitious, and four from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes — the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution — but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I would suggest that in the future when closing votes you check the history to determine the authorship of unsigned votes. I also think the quality and nature of the arguments presented are more important than the raw vote count. I would like to renominate these articles, but I'm not sure what the rules on that are. I guess I'll have to go read the deletion policy.

In the Sin Star article it says, """"Such promotional activities carried out by fans have gone as far as having MTV.com tricked into placing a Sin Star artist biography on their site however this was promptly removed the same day."""" It also says their debut album will come out next year, and that they don't have a label. It seems they have been more successful at defacing Wikipedia than they were at MTV.com.  """,0

Hi Peter.  I'm not an admin, but I do a fair amount of quality-control on Wikipedia - you've might have spotted 1 or 2 warnings I've issued in the past.  We both know the system usually works very well, provided users are given fair and appropriate, escalating warnings, eventually being reported if they continue.

User:Lord Loxley's reply, with my own comments 

""""The recidivism rate of TharkunColl is sad, for he has vowed to disrupt the Wikipedia to make a point. Here he attempts yet again, to blow smoke all our arses.""""

You are the one who is disrupting Wikipedia. I am upholding the consensus.

""""TharkunColl believes that the English and Welsh are not ethnic twins of Southern Britain (in the present day and age), perhaps unaware that they are indistinguishable to the world at large. The Principality of Wales has not been its own country since before Edward I of England, while the Principality of Liechtenstein is an independent country that has no real ethnic status different from its neighbours. His argument is to play up national-separatist sentiments that serve nobody in the present day, about a Principality vis a vis Kingdomwhich form bestows actual ethnic statuses to peoples. Wales has never been featured on the arms of state and seals of office that denote independence, the chief marker of separate identity among the nations in Europe. That the Welsh people page exists, doesn't qualify its existence. This guy believes that there is a sort of """"Anglo-Celtic subrace"""" of Europeans, that is defined only by the British Isles (an idea only popular among xenophobic yobbos proud of the British Empire's world domination, in an era circa the Great War). He believes that Brittany is part of the British Isles, rather than a former duchy in the Kingdom of Franceby choice over allegiance to England in the Breton War of Succession. He believes that mass settlement, colonisation and the transcendence of national cultures is arguable in favour of the people under Canute the Great's dominion as governed by Winchester, but denies any significance in relations from 1066 (until the present) as determined by London and what the Normans did which transformed the populace in all waysespecially ancestry and tongue, to form actual and extant connections with the French, Scots and Irishthe countries England has dealt with for the past millenium. He uses racial definitions in respect to the """"Celtic fringe"""" and their English relationship, for we all know how the English never held special favour to them until the Hanoverians changed the political climate and drew sympathy from the English for the harsh oppressions of that regime which never bred into the population of the British Isles and was """"naturally nativised"""". The user believes the Norman Conquest was as removed from the people as the Constitutional Hanoverian rule, but more bloody and causing a Marxist class struggle between monarch and subject for centuries as opposed to a few decades in which it was possible to secure their integration as part of the English people themselves. My other opponent User:Enzedbrit believes that the Norman Channel Islanders are no different from the English, but TharkunColl thinks they are foreigners (since 1066) compared to the Celtic fringe (whom only assimilated to the English way of life because of aftereffects created by the Norman Conquest of England). This person has attacked my nationality as Canadian and put my knowledge into question, simply because I'm not jingoistic to punish the French in any and every discussion of themwe in Canada have learnt to get along, because English and French are more alike than differentdespite intense rivalry. He tries to speak with authority and down to me, while it is obvious that he is a crank out of the mainstream of academic institutions but well within the realm of football hooliganism.""""

Read what I wrote. I believe that the Welsh and English are indeed very close, but quite obviously still retain separate ethnic identities. You are trying to say that they are English. For your own sake, please don't say that if you ever go to Wales. I have never made any claims about an """"Anglo-Celtic subrace"""" and nor do I believe Britanny is part of the British Isles. Why do you ascribe false beliefs to me? As for you being a Canadian, all it means is that you may have a completely false view of what the English are like, based on your misperception of history. As I said, just because Canada is an Anglo-French society, it doesn't mean that England is. And the only crank here is you I'm afraid.

""""I made a reference to the Tudors being England's chief representative of the Romano-British in England's culture and identity, which you think is ludicrous or have problems interpreting what was written. It was the Tudors who brought a revival of King Arthur, which made it an official mythology of England.""""

The Tudors lived about a thousand years after the Romano-British period, so to call them a representation of it sounds a tad unreasonable. And their revival of the Arthurian myths was purely political.

Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.

If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.

It says....

A hypothesis of distant genetic relationship
taking its name from the Altai mountains of central
Asia; it holds that Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic
(Manchu-Tungusic), together comprising some forty
languages, are genetically related. More extended
versions of the Altaic hypothesis would include Korean
and Japanese, sometimes also Ainu. Various scholars in
the early and mid 1800s proposed classifications that
would group some or all of the ‘Altaic’ languages
together, but typically these were included in larger, more
poorly defined proposed affiliations, such as the now
abandoned Ural-Altaic hypothesis.(p.7)

Now abandoned is Ural-Altaic relation which was replaced with , not Altaic.

Eurasiatic Greenberg’s (2000, 2002) hypothesis of a
distant genetic relationship that would group Indo-
European, Uralic–Yukaghir, Altaic, Korean–Japanese–
Ainu, Nivkh, Chukotian and Eskimo–Aleut as members
of a very large ‘linguistic stock’. While there is considerable
overlap in the putative members of Eurasiatic and
Nostratic there are also significant differences. Eurasiatic
has been sharply criticized and is largely rejected by
specialists (Georg and Vovin 2003, 2005). (p. 58)

 A week at the Tito article 

Hi Guys,

I know that what I said to you in my outburst, the one that earned me a weekend in the cooler, was wrong. Of course it was. I apologise to you for that. A week later, however, I think you can see what we are up against here in the 'Balkan' domain. AndreaFox entered a post at ANI which superficially looked genuine. You all supported him/her. With hindsight, it can be seen that the edit(s) entered that DIREKTOR and I opposed/rejected/reverted were appallingly POV and supported by a desperate scratching around for internet sources that, when found, ranged from the neo-fascist (Sunić/IHR) to the vaguely circumstantial (Meares the translator). I, personally, have no doubt that Tito was no angel - he was a flawed human being, just as we all are - but I will not stand idly by while POV monsters attempt to abuse our Wikipedia to """"fight the good fight"""". That's why I was (unacceptably) angry a week ago, but I hope that the developments of the last week enable you all to see what we face here. I, speaking only for myself, think that the Tito article in question dwells way too much on the WWII period, with not enough on the major period that should be covered, namely his time as head of state.

Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland‎' bias accusation
It's one thing to disagree on content, another entirely for you to make an accusation of bias. If you have any moral compass whatsoever, you will now either substantiate your accusation or withdraw it and apologise. Ad hominem attacks are not acceptable.  (talk) 
It was not an attack. It was an observation. You've already distorted her words. For example, you inserted a claim that """"she dismisses criticism as uninformed and bitchy"""", which is not what the source said. If my observation was wrong, I am sorry, but I'm not convinced that it was. I hope that you will prove otherwise.   
The leap you need to explain is how you get from your assertion of """"not what the source said"""" to bias. The source said of one set of critics """"Gardeners are quite bitchy, aren't they"""". Of another, """"There was only a handful of grand English lady designers, and the bitchiness I encountered was unbelievable"""". These would seem to support an assertion that she dismissed critics as bitchy. How many times in one piece must we read such dismissals before we conclude that she dismisses critics as bitchy? And how, however you view my sentence construction, does it amount to bias? You have made the assertion. It is now down to you to explain yourself.  (talk) 

This isn't going away, Surtsicna. You no more get to walk away from this than you would if you'd accused a banker of fraud or a teacher of child abuse. Either explain how any of my actions amount to bias, withdraw the accusation, or accept that you are a deeply flawed individual lacking in the basic common courtesies. And - again as common courtesy - start using edit summaries. There really is no excuse for your behaviour.  (talk) """,0

Thus I was not especially considering whether the ECB is independent of the EU or not, that being irrelevant. Both are organisations which form part of the wider 'EU' which is what we have written about in this article, not simply the definition in the treaty on european union. My primary consideration is to what extent any of these organisations are independent of the member states, not of each other.

"To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.
The development of sophisticated complex non-linearly driven four-group based designs (focusing, variator, compensator, relay master) is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques, computation algorithms, manufacturing — e.g. lower cost aspherical lenses, numerical control machines to manufacture precise non-linear driving cams — and material science — e.g. glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics.",0

First off let's be clear, this is a proposed merger not a deletion. Looking at your argument of other stuff exists, the only HD specific example that you have mentioned (List of DirecTV local channels with HD) compares the availability of affiliated HD channels between cities, not a million miles away from this page comparing channel availability between platforms. The other examples that you have given are lists per platform, as you said. The fact is HD channels on Sky do form a part of Sky Digital and not another platform called Sky+ HD, HD channels are clearly labelled on List of channels on Sky Digital as being in HD were applicable. There is absolutely no distinction in the amount of HD content shown, if it simulcasts with an SD channel etc. on the same channel between platforms. There is no need for a list of channels in a certain broadcast format on a certain platform and it seems like content forking and listcruft. You also mentioned size, labelling this page as potentially """"unwieldy"""", there are clear guidelines for the size of articles and compared to the other lists that you mentioned, this page could double in size without problems. If you want to talk long term, then in the future it's likely that being in HD or knowing if a channel uses up-scaling won't be especially notable just as being in 16:9 or using widescreen switching or stretching/zooming isn't today and at some point this page could also end up being merged or otherwise. By the way, there is a List of television stations in the United Kingdom (foreign versions may be found at Lists of television channels) and I agree that it is somewhat impractical for certain tasks. As for Andrewcrawford's actions, Help:Merging explains that """"If you think merging something improves the encyclopaedia, you can be bold and perform the merger, as described below. Because of this, it makes little sense to object to a merger purely on procedural grounds, e.g. """"you cannot do that without discussion"""" is not a good argument.

If you are uncertain of the merger's appropriateness, or believe it might be controversial, or your merger ends up reverted, you can propose it on either or both of the affected pages.""""

PS- The below is simply wrong and I would like an apology!!!! and would like the seeking alpha references put back in place -  thank you

The source used by the article was a press release from Pasternak‎'s lawyers. If we have the comment carried by reliable sources third party sources, then perhaps. But WP:BLP: """"Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons—whether the material is negative, positive, or just questionable—should be removed immediately """" (emph added).  The Red Pen of Doom 
I was agreeing with your removal, so you don't have to justify it to me, but you're still wrong about who the source was from. It wasn't from his lawyers. It was from seeking alpha, and you summarized the edit as """"After Knight Trading: a press release from Pasternak's lawyers is not valid source for WP:PEACOCK language"""". I think you just didn't notice the reference with the seeking alpha site before the reference with the law firm site. 
Also, it is not an explicit policy to remove all sources that come from a client's law firm, particularly when they state facts about the disposition of a case. WP:RS does not indicate party-affiliated sources cannot be moved. In fact, it provides explicit guidelines for when its inclusion is appropriate (WP:SELFPUB). Also, the WP:BLP policy has two parts for removal of facts from a BLP: 1) the fact has to be unsourced or poorly sourced, and 2) the source must not be """"written by the subject of the BLP"""". In this case, it was written by [presumably] his lawyers. Either his lawyers stand in his shoes, and so it fails #1 (because it's poorly sourced by virtue of not being sufficiently second-party, a contention which isn't cut and dried) but meets #2 (because it's written by his represenatatives), or it doesn't fail #1 but does fail #2 (a strange place to be).

Jsut some information for cultural purposes: 
Where does the word """"Catalán"""" comes from: It is French. It means the """"inhabitant of the Castles"""" or """"Chastlains"""" or """"castlans"""" (exactly the same than """"Castilian"""").
When the word """"Catalán"""" appears for the first time. In 1115, mentioned by an italian cronist.
When Catalonia became really independent?. By the Treaty of Corbeil, in 1248 when the French Monarchie gave up his rights on the Marca Hispanica castles.
Where was the idealised hero of Barcelona Wifredo el Vellosos born  in France, in Carcassone.
Was Roger of Lauria, the """"great catalonian hero"""" catalán. Not at all, he was born in Lauria (Italy) and served the King of Aragón.
Were there Kings in Cataluña. No, never existed.
Were there a Principado of Cataluña?. No, never. It is a Prince of Gerona, but never was Cataluña a Principado.
Stop trying to be what you are not. You may be proud of some other things, but neither you have ever been a Kingdom, not a Principado, nor you have had a clasic literature in catalán.
Catalán is a dialect steaming from latin, exactly the same than castillian, provenzal, italian or valenciano. The difffrence is that, while Valenciano had a dictionary  (Liber Elegantiarum), clasic romans (Tirant lo Blanch), traslations of the Bible to Valenciano (Bonifacio Ferrer), etc.. (ALL THEM MENTIONING BLACK ON WHITE THAT THEY WROTE IN VALENCIANO LANGUAGE), the Catalans had nothing, and this is way the catalans desperately need to try to absorb the Valenciano, becuase in catalan there is nothing to show.
However, culture is culture, and mixtifications are only for ignorants.

I'm not talking about belief of majority. In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree.

You can object because it's unclear, but your statement """"he did not claim he was god"""" is merely your opinion. You really can't prove it. Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed. Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God.

Jorfer's complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0.999... = 1 .  His issue, rather, is rather the concept of limits actually """"applies"""" to """"real life"""".  He is agreeing that the series (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...) has a limit of 1, but he is not agreeing that the corresponding decimal 0.999... should be said to be equal to 1, but that they must instead differ by some as yet undefined infinitesimal amount.

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.  Since 0.999... and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity, and the only such quanity in the reals is zero, 1 - 0.999... = 0 and thus 1 = 0.999...  """,0

But, in general, there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors (or between even and odd) when it comes to integrands.  An example in one dimension, when  and  is:

The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor (or odd tensor) density, but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher; in a higher-dimensional example they would be no longer right-handed.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor (or even tensor) density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order, −b < −a; in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining right-handedness.  The usual convention I've seen is to keep the coordinates right-handed and to transform the integrand as a pseudotensor density, but the other approach is equally valid.  — (talk | contribs) """,0

Your claims demonstrate a lack of concern to find the actual truth in this situation, so I urge you, please, consider the actual truth carefully.

Here, from the talk page, three other editors confirming my judgment of just how """"embarassing"""" the current article is, and which contributes to the common conception among academics that Wikipedia is primarily written by intellectually disabled kindergartners and high-school dropouts on a power-trip: 
'm sorry but the introduction is an embarrassingly crass articulation of what Heidegger's project is about. It is embarrassing and needs to be fixed!

I agree, especially with sources. From what I understand of Heidegger, the three paragraphs in the introduction are roughly accurate, but they require edits to become smooth and easily understandable. But most importantly, there are no references!! I find the biography and following subjects are for the most part thoroughly cited, but the intro is not? I will keep my eye out for references, but anyone who is knowledgable and wellread on the subject should consider adding references to the introduction. Jdanbeck (talk) 
I'd say the second paragraph is inaccurate, and in fact absolute nonsense. It neither reflects Heidegger's position, nor is coherent in itself. There used to be a decent intro. Revert to it? KD Tries Again (talk) KD Tries Again

And then, have a look at the fact that 4 editors supported me, before a single WIKILAWYER arrived at the scene, to mass delete. How exactly can I """"lose"""" an argument about Heidegger by calling you Hitler? Whether or not you or I or anyone is an idiot or a Nazi or whatever has no reflection on whether or not the current article ACTIVELY SPREADS MISINFORMATION, as I have repeatedly stated and showed.

It is clear that the worst proclaimed by the opponents of the Wikipedia is true.

That it is more interested in appeasing the egos of those in charge than pursuing the concept of dispassionate information.

When a female editor is able to suppress the revelation of a complete quote, which refutes her desire that only two words of that same quote were true, because a male editor is too infatuated to reject her perversion of the truth, then the Wikipedia has rejected ANY pretense to being more than what it is, which isn't much.

Look guys, I just checked with several doctors, three lawyers and a couple of judges and they all say that there are many questions they get which they only have a partial answer for or no information about at all and must therefore use their professional judgment and experience to provide an answer so that the right way to handle either a legal or to a medical question is to include a clear and simple disclaimer whether you are otherwise qualified to provide and answer of not. 

In other words it is far better not to delete a question but rather to answer it to the best of your ability and then add a disclaimer even if you are sure your answer is one hundred percent provable by the facts. Otherwise you should simply leave the question alone and not answer it at all and instead remove the answers which do not include a disclaimer or may be contrary to facts. 

Also, no one can be held responsible for providing an answer to a question, even if a disclaimer is not attached, in any scenario where the answer or """"advice"""" is free of financial charge. In other words, unless you require something of values in exchange for your answer or """"advice"""" you can not be held responsible for what your answer is. 

This is of course not the case when questioned by a police officer or other official or officer of the court who represent the State and are seeking an answer on the State's behalf. If you choose to answer their questions then you are obligated by law to tell them the truth although you are likewise permitted to withhold an answer or to provide a disclaimer if you do not.

I've read through the above and I've looked up the article in question on the NEJM website.  is correct in saying he can make basic calculations without it being considered 'original research', but your calculation is not correct. The figures involve the median survival rates, not the mean rates and as such, simply subtracting one figure from the other produces an inaccurate statistic. The median survival rate is simply the middle point between the two extremes - so if one person died after one year and one person died after two years, the median survival rate would be 1.5 years, even if 99% of people died after 1.1 years. Therefore, your figure implies something that is not the case.
The abstract explicitly states the following:
This reduction represented a 4.1-month improvement in median survival (25.8 months in the sipuleucel-T group vs. 21.7 months in the placebo group).
I think that if the survival advantage was 14.2 months, much more attention would be drawn to this figure, rather than the only figure to be highlighted of 4.1 months.

The saxophone is a new instrument to the musical world in terms of time. In the specific realm of jazz is the ring leader of the genre, with the close second being the trumpet. Can you really argue with the fact that the sax has changed jazz in it's entirty, from swing to bop, to samba, to fusion and modern. Charlie Parker revolutionized jazz by playing the sax with a classical ensamble. Stan Getz led the short but very important samba movement with his smooth style and grace on his tenor sax. Michael Brecker, who recntly died of a rare form of Lukemia ( i think), was a beast of a player that revolutionized modern jazz. And then there's Jimmy Picket from Tower of Power who brought sax to the funk style. I rest my case on the issue.",0

A tag has been placed on Jesus eduardo talamante zayas requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

content moved from bennelong medal talk page
I feel this page is notable as it is not included on the Bennelong Society entry, where it should rightly go. I attempted to put it there and it was repeatedly deleted and I did not want to enter an edit war. Therefore it exists as a separate page.

 There appear to be some mentions in Google; you should add some to the article.  

I removed the notability warning as  seems to have contradicted himself by adding a notability warning prior to checking basic searches such as google. I'll add some links and expand the article so it can be merged back into Bennelong Society when time permits (unless  would like to make some constructive edits? ) ).  

 Article did not cite any third party sources when I added the tag; the onus is not on other editors to cite sources for material.  

 What on thi spage needs cleaning up? It states the data and the source. What else could there be. The article did site one third party source at the time of you first tagging, it was within the body of the article, as it was a hyperlink, as opposed to at the end. This surely suggests that you have not actually read the article fully.

New Additions and Changes
After a long time away from this article waiting for the peer review to be finalized, I've returned to work on this article. Just wanted to list some of the additions and changes.

The biggest one (IMHO) is the change citations from parenthetical to footnote/bibliography style. Also, the footnotes and bibliography are in a reduced font, done in a style that can be seen in Hugo Chavez. Given that the Chavez article won featured article status, I'm going to take the """"if you can't beat'em, join'em"""" approach. 
I got ahold of a decent biography of Suharto that really illuminates Suharto's pre-presidential years. It's R.E. Elson's Suharto: A Political Biography. I plan on making some further additions using this book as a reference.
In tandem with the Elson book, I managed to find some halfway decent pictures of him that I believe should be public domain, if not fair use. So now we have a lead photo again! They're from the Department of Information and State Secretariat of Indonesia. If anyone has a halfway decent knowledge of Indonesian intellectual property law (besides the lack of any enforcement), it'd be very appreciated.

For the future, I am looking to fatten up the portion on Suharto's military career, but eventually it will be exported to its own article (e.g. Military career of Suharto), much in the same way the Civil War and New Order sections got fattened up, exported, then trimmed.

After that is done, I hope to do another round of peer review, and then based on that nominating this to Wikipedia:Featured article candidates  """,0

States should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present.

This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).

There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began. And, diffferent groups can live in peace side to side, with different language, cultures, co-existing with the same country, united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

"Anarchism versus Religion 

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Embrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude.",0

====I agree. The explanation given by the OP makes no sense. I have sailed these waters many, many times. If you are off """"Kanagawa"""" in Sagami Bay, then Fuji San is to the northwest and Edo (Tokyo) is the to north northeast. The boats are moving to the southeast towards the coast of the Izu peninsula. Because of Fuji San's height above sea level and the reflectivity of snow you do not have to be due east of the mountain to observe a spectacular sun rise. Further confusing the issue, the """"Kanagawa"""" in the title of the print does not refer to Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa Prefecture was established in 1876. Prior to that time, the easternmost part of what is now Kanagawa Prefecture was known as the Province of  Musashi. The westernmost part was known as the province of Sagami. The title may refer to an area in Musashi Province near what is now the city of Yokohama. The problem with this is that you do not see waves of this size in the confined waters of Tokyo Bay. You are only going to see them in Sagami Bay which is consistent with the geography in the print.

The initial criticism was that Stringer should be added as a source. It appears nobody follows this Talk page who has the expertise in anthropology (nor even the common sense) to comprehend that Stringer is an expert source who should be added to this article and it is now a badly-outdated article, as no valid challenges have been brought forth that would exclude Stringer's opinion from Wikipedia articles (and despite the very long period given to Wikipedians to challenge it), and thus:

I concur that this article should be unlocked, because, for example, see also my request for another year-old source to be updated, which is crucial as it is in the lede, and claiming that the RAO hypothesis is still the mainstream hypothesis in human evolution, when even those anthropologists who are cited as calling it the """"mainstream"""" hypothesis have retracted that claim and you are therefore basically misinforming a new generation of K-12 students, year-by-year, as you've kept this page outdated since 2010. It is obvious that no Wikipedians with expertise in anthropology have editing-rights to this locked article and are being responsible enough to maintain this article since approximately 2010, not even responsible enough to add simple {update} and {POV dispute} types of tags.

So, who locked this article? And why is it still locked for years when the person who locked it doesn't have either the due diligence and care, or else the expertise in anthropology, to maintain the page as being up-to-date within even three years, yet they took the responsibility for locking it and no """"elder Wikipedians"""" have addressed the issue?

A report by the WAG in 2003  discussed access to CIA, and the tone of the report indicates that they consider CIA to be a major destination (although they do not specifically state that).

The article itself says that is hasn't been concluded who built the mound. You've already conceded Middle East links to the region by admitting the X is found in the ancient Americas, which is already confirmed by bioarcheology. The X came from N, which came from West Asia, largely found around present-day Turkey and throughout the region. One of the Odin's ancestors came from the area of modern-day Turkey, and the X has been found in similarities to groups both in Sweden and ancient America, while the Adena mound sites have been found to be similar to those found in Sweden. The high-level of X found along the Atlantic-Artic travel routes suggest it could have came to the continent that way, but that is for archeologists to determine. See:

 A barnstar for you! 

  The Civility Barnstar Your recent edits on historical Jesus deserve this star, because you used a novel approach that didn't give civility for it's own sake, but where it was deserved. Many people have tried to edit pages on Jesus, Religion in Nazi Germany, Religious views of Adolf Hitler, etc. and run into the exact situation you described. When they approach it with too much civility they get run off and bullied by teams of Christian editors. It's about time someone approached the situation with the civility that is needed. Brother, I have run into so many dubious sources, and what's worse absolute abominations and interpolations on legit sources. They've been doing it for 2000 years, is it any surprise that Wikipedia wouldn't be a magnet for Christian interpolations? What's worse, if you remove it, it gets reverted by not one, but two or three others and they watch every page religiously. There's a group, I estimate of about 100 who have ruined Wikipedia, and some of them are admins.   """,0

Witness Brigish English, Mandarin (linguistics), Flemish (linguistics), Ashkenazi Hebrew, Cantonese (linguistics), American English, Sephardi Hebrew, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore Arvanitic language or Arvanitika language are out of the question. I don't want to use Arvanitika Albanian as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are Arvanitic or Arvanitika. They can and should be used. Arvanitic has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to WP:V and WP:NOR. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (Hiberno English) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument.

"""::Describing the Jesus Bloodline as being linked to traditionalist """"esoteric Christianity"""" will always exist without a citation and reliable and independent source. If 
Jesus Bloodline is to be linked to """"esoteric Christianity"""" it needs to be emphasised that it is to an untraditional and modern version of """"esoteric Christianity"""" that has been influenced by Margaret Starbird. And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism """"believed that Jesus Christ was a human being"""", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being.

It looks like the discussion has been mentioned on the village pump as well, so hopefully some other viewpoints on the situation can help the discussion. 

Personally, I agree with the general usage, like I said, I think its much of the same reason that the history is a separate page and text submission isn't credited in the article either - accessibility, readability and standardization.  I don't see a compelling reason yet to change the guidelines - in this case, there was another free image available without the caption concern.  I imagine there will be cases that it would be difficult to get another free image, but in my experience, most contributors to Wikipedia are willing to abide by the policies and guidelines when someone takes the time to educate them.    babelfish

Saying that some information you add to an article is based on 'privileged' knowledge is really not allowed on Wikipedia, because what you are saying is that you know something that nobody else could know or verify.

Hi there. Not wanting to start a war over this. This stub is very vague and I was attempting to add some clarity to it. Because it now reads: """"martyred"""" and """"mostly Roman Catholics and Chinese"""" and it is not a neutral point of view. """"...other churches recognized their own martyrs"""" implies that the others who were killed for their faith were not part of """"THE Chines Martyrs"""". The fact that they are accepted as """"martyrs"""" by the Roman church does not make them """"martyrs"""" in the Orthodox or even the Protestant sense. So, since the meager content of this stub is mostly about the Roman Catholic individuals who were cannonized, it is appropriate to divide things and qualify things as I had done. There are undoubtably many who will oppose the term """"Martyrs"""" itself in the title because of the modern cultural connotations that it carries like """"Martyrs of Sept. 11 (hijackers)...But it does work if this article is limited to the Papal decree that popularized a phrase - if that is what it is.

Soon after BobJoeBob was born Raybilly (who looks old for his age) opened up his own buisness, unfortunately in 2000, when Fred was bord the buisness went under. Raybilly feared the worst and fled with the 15 year olds savings. Muriel sadie Mary was devostated but somehow carried on. over the next 10 years she had another 6 kids all with different parents. Bur in January 2010 the silver lining came for BobJoeBob, he found Captain. Captain is a former sailor, who loved his rum and unfortunately had a few altercations while under the influence of alcahol! Now the 2 reside in Jacksonville on a cosy houseboat.

Sorry, my bad. In response to the query you left on my talk page, some specific (but by no means the only) examples which I found problematic are:

""""At a separate website, which may be accessed through his main site, T-shirts bearing Grossman's designs are available.""""
The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""
have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. The article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of Grossman, but I don't see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. I would say in general that you need to be wary of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:V.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0

No prob.  Thanks for contacting me.  Believe me, I'd rather help you than block you.  So, here's some reading material:  Wikipedia:Manual of style.  This is an excellent resource for learning how to contribute here.  I'm also as close as my talk page.  Sorry to have come off harsh, but you wouldn't believe the sort of really weird edits from people who mean to harm the site instead of help it.  I'm extremely pleased to help you if you'd like. -  

Wiki brah, why did you move a nomination for admin?  I'm not objecting, just confused.  Also, btw, how did you come across that page - it's not a usual page for new users to come across at first. Thanks in advance for your response.  

Ho cakes

Uh, right.  )

WB, what are you doing...?  I said I'd help you but if you do another edit like that last one, it'll be a time out.  OK?  No more weirdness?  Thanks. -  

Well, in order to stay, your articles really need to meet a certain level of quality.  I'm sure you mean well, but you really need to settle down a tad and get a feel for the site.  You can't treat this like a blog page.  """"Ho cakes?""""  I admit, it made me laugh, especially the """"featured article"""" header.  But...stuff like that really isn't the best use of the site's resources.  The nice folks who pay for the servers want the best possible return on their investment.  Tell you what:  I have to run, but if you have an idea for an article, why not stop by my talk page and let me know what it is?  Maybe if I show you how to write a good article, you might understand WIkipedia better. -  

It's OK.  We'll get you up to speed.  However, you should decide on a single user name.  Right now, you're bouncing between three of them.  How 'bout we just stick with this one here? -  

Last warning.  If you continue to post nonsense, or to disrupt Wikipedia by slapping a delete template on Cindy Sheehan, you WILL be blocked.   01:52, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, that is exactly what I was coming here to do.  That was uncalled for as was """"Monkey spank.""""  Gotta give you a time out for a couple of days for disrupting this site.  Nothing personal.  However, you can still edit this page if you wish to respond to the block. -  

 Good Morning

I read some guidelines and articles and don't think she is a notable person just like a stuntwoman on tv for brief fame.  I am getting better but still sort of autistic my parents still keep me here. 

No one wants to be mean to you.  I had a feeling you were autistic and I'm working with a couple of other autistic users.  We welcome you here.  But, you need to remember that this isn't a playground and that you simply can't edit the way you have been.  I'm giving you one more chance.  I'll remove your block, but only if you do the right thing, OK?  Let us all help you. -  

OK, Brah.  I've unblocked you.  Now, please be good and edit like I know you can.  I have to go, but I'm keeping an eye on you.  )  Thanks. -  

Hi, WB.  Man, I'm glad it was you and not the vandal I'm dealing with right now who's messing up my page.  

If you want, I'll gladly paste that English-speaking template to your user page.  As far as making templates is concerned, they're pretty much like making articles, but I think you have to have the green light from other users before you create one.  I'll look into that for you.  Gotta run after I fix your user page. -

"Úbeda 

Hello, sorry for the long message.

In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move Úbeda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see  Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed).

However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time.  The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally.  Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode).

However, for Úbeda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to Úbeda.  My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting  that was the whole purpose of the survey.  In discussion with him, I wrote:
Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues.
See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed).

As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask:
 Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey?

Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond.",0

""""Acting as a scientist"""" is a very subjective notion. 
Since all non-creation scientists rely on the presumption of naturalism when dealing in """"origins"""" (non-observational) science, which is not subject to the scientific method, then essentially all non-creation scientists are not doing science.

A number of conquest attempts were launched against Prussia by Poland, (ref External link William Pierson book), also

Marija Gimbutas in her book: The Balts - describes the Prussian and Baltic territory reaching much further west, south, south-west, south-east than the later Prussia, when Poland came into existense and conquered much additional territory (claimed by Polish to have been a """"uniting of Polish tribes""""), however for centuries rejected and fought against by the ones involved.

Prussians are also recorded as Ulmerugi, Holmrugi (Island Rugians in the Vistula river area. That name still showed up on maps of area around Culm, Culmerland, Kulmerland territory which was surrounded by the Vistula river.  

Boleslaw I claimed to have conquered (part of) the Prussians and even his headstone is supposed to have shown something like this. He also claimed to have put 'columns' (pillars) up in the newly conquered Prussian territory, to mark the new border of territory, which he now claimed as his, which was not his.

So ,Szopen, Culmerland was not Polish land- it was Prussian land, partially conquered temporarily by Poland. 

Gethen, Getae is yet another name for the Prussians, that name was still known to Polish historians as well.

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain, however; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",0

Speedy deletion of Thomas Essomba
 A tag has been placed on Thomas Essomba requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.   –   """,0

"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

Now, related to the 2nd one, what do you think about:
While Vargas and the military leadership were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, they instead closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. With the non fulfillment of promised democratic reforms, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power, as well as in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

Thank you.

I've posted an Associated Press article that appeared on the news wires today, on the discussion page for nitrites.

The article validates my concerns about Wikipedia. I imagine you'll edit it out, or delete it.

I suspect that the general public 'gets it' about Wikipedia, too.

It's regrettable that the folks who are the most knowledgeable about, and best able to use, the intracacies of Wikipedia's rules and regulations are also the people best equipted to use that knowlege to stifle newbies, and/or those who are less computer-savvy, who may make mistakes, or who haven't even yet heard about what a 'sock puppet' is, or RR32 rule, or whatever rules you and heah used to stifle my contributons.

I doubt you'll 'get it', nor do I care.  But, at the end of the day, just maybe   there's a chance that you'll actually understand the damage you do by your holier-than-thou attitudes, and arrogant computer-geek power-plays.

This is in no way meant to be a personal attack"""" on you or heah, or anyone else who edits in Wikipedia. It's simply the reaction of an ordinary guy, based on his observations and experiences after being stifled by those who dissagreed with his edits. You and heah, in addition to not agreeing with my edits, clearly have the superiour knowledge of how Wikipedia works, which made it easy for you to throw  down obstables to my postings, make false allegations of wrong doing, and activate Wikipedia's rules to either threaten to ban me or block me, or  as you did, to actually ban or block me. 

But the more important issue  and problem  is for Wikipedia itself; namely, that this kind of censorship is akin to the autoritarion rulers whose people are only allowed to see or read whatever the rulers deem suitable  which will, as I've said before, only serve to further diminish the already tarnished reputaton of Wikipedia.

Night: Here's your cite, which actually addresses several of your wishes: WP Biographies of Living Persons. You should look especially to: """"Using the subject as a self-published source"""" - it states that """"the article is not based primarily on such sources."""". Thirteen of your eighteen source references are to Pedro and Me, or Winick's personal sites (yes, IMDB counts). For example, you cite the book as the reason for keeping in the discussion of Rainey, while I repeat-it's an isolated, non-turning-point event in his life. It is appropriate for the Real World page, perhaps, but here it's a little off-topic. You might as well put in the name of a flavor of ice cream he doesn't like, or that someone was mean to him in middle school. It's just not important enough for what should be a short bio. And a link to Zamora's bio can cover his illness, a mention that he had HIV/AIDS and was ill covers him quite nicelythere's no need to go into it, except for the impact it had on Winick. I'm just trying to get the article back on track as a one-topic writing hereI'm not """"accusing"""" you of anything. 

To answer your direct question, see the heading """"Presumption in Favor of Privacy"""", under """"Privacy of Birthdays"""" on the same page-it may be published elsewhere, but I don't know that he's quite notable enough to justify keeping the full date-where's the harm in only noting the year?

"On the law of Kamma 

I have added a section on the law of Kamma. I prefer to call it Kamma (pali) instead of Karma ( sanskrit) as there is a negative meaning associated with Karma. Karma in the Hindu context means that ones deeds performed in previous lives are responsible for ones present conditions. This is a very pernicious Hindu doctrine and has been advanced by Hindu priests to escape from the social responsibility of alleaviting a man's condition. As per this doctrine all the poverty stricken, destitute people in this world must have been criminals in their previous lives. This cannot be true

The Buddhist law of kamma differs from the Hindu theory of Karma in this aspect. The buddhist law of kamma states that all actions are irreversable.

""":::: But in what sense can that comment possibly be “correct”? """"Provided that what is sourced is already in the article""""! I can't let that pass, as it is just so damaging - so I'm going to say a few things. You cannot just ‘summarise’ any old group of citations (sometime creating a new thing altogether in doing so - which is excempt from needing proof) – you are absolutely obliged to consider WP:weight, along with other of the many guidelines like WP:red flag in Verifiability, and Notability too. Weight alone will more often than not dictate the new text, as it has done now. 

These retentive methods of ‘Style reviewing’ are a plague across the full scope of Wikipedia, and this article highlights the foolishness (too long maintained) of methodically tick-boxing inherently illogical style-correctness, whilst routinely (ie as a kind of 'policy') ignoring content( which is ironically seen as the job of the editors, who actually get sidelined in the process). In teh past I've seen so many foolish paragraphs pass though ‘style’, even in Featured Articles (another content-shy process believe it or not). There really is nothing clever about being so clinical when it leads to plain misrepresentation, especially with a subject like this. Many non-British would will be mislead by the text on a basic ‘reader’ level here anyway, which just adds more irony to the process of course . As a rule, it is good to consider what you are doing in life in anyway, regardless of your job.

What happened in Nick Griffin is that simple event-verifying  citations from within the article (the few cases of Griffin being invited to speak at mainstream establishments) were converted into a kind of super-flexible ‘source’ material’, which (in that new state) were easily moulded into the stand-alone line """"Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""" I strongly suspect that no one got a shoe-in to actually add any weight, due to the rigid system involved - where new  content is demoted in value, and even at times discouraged. I’ve seen it happen too often, it’s just plain dumb. What’s worse, a general ethos of ‘protecting the result’ comes from the process, which ended here in me being accused of ‘vandalism’ for attempting change, which I really object to. It really is dumb.

Imagine someone collecting a handful of citations of various people expressing an opinion (shall we say of black people being inferior to whites?) and places them in a relevant section in an article (say a """"Controversy"""" section in a new and developing article called """"Racism"""") . According to Wikipedia’s Style Council, this line inserted at the end of the intro would theoretically be fine: """"Many people believe that black people are inferior to whites”. As there was nothing in the developing article about the many issues surrounding IQ test and the reading of them both past and present, no balance is made, and the Intro passes with flying colours. The new authorised version is then considered as ‘passing consensus’ – a broadly finished thing that is duly protected from change.

The Intro equation I’ve seen many times is: X (citations of comments existing somewhere i n the article) = Z (a new flexible ‘source’ material  when grouped) = Y (a new and uncited statement of fact, based on the new entity of the ‘source’). THE INNER WORKINGS OF ‘SUMMARY’ ARE SIMPLY NOT APPARENT TO THE TYPICAL WIKIPEDIA READER, who is always at the very bottom of the Wikipedia heap, just below the general editor.

Articles like Nick Griffin can be difficult and need creative work on the edit level - but that is the point. So much time on Wikipedia is wasted on stylising incomplete articles and weak unbalanced text. It is no way to bypass edit conflict - that ‘’’has’’’ to be done the hard way, such as in finding ways to express weight. Risking edit battles is far superior to squeezing down to make-shift style-approved articles that are subsequently protected from change. Here that process made the introduction bland, weak and misleading, and the added factor of the subject's inherent extremity ensured the article became seriously misleading – to the point that the article became Nick Griffin-friendly, and hence ultimate",0

 WikiProject Ireland 

  Participants are requested to VOTE each month for their choice of Showcase Article and Showcase Picture.It only takes a minute - please participate!  

 Scope and Motivation 
Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize information in articles related to Ireland.  This page and its subpages contain their ideas; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians.  If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list there.

The vast majority of this project was unashamedly ripped from another project: Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles, and the  of this project extends recognition for the tireless work involved in formatting, text, policy and many other aspects by ,  and himself.

For more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.

This project has been created in an attempt to improve existing articles relating to Ireland, and to help with the creation of needed articles. It aims primarily to provide information in consistent format for articles on places in, or related to Ireland.  On top of this, it aims to get the main Ireland article to featured status, whilst aiding the maintenance and improvement of the Ireland Portal.

 Northern Ieland has a population of approximately 1.7 million.

 One of the greatest aids in this project for assessment and improving of articles, are the  logs found here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/1 and here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/2. Please take a look at the entries there as it will guide you on which articles need assessed, and will also guide you as to what might be necessary to improve individual articles.

Articles and categories relating to Ireland are extensive and work needs to be/is being done across a multitude of areas.  In order to gain the benefits of collaboration, please update this page with any relevant """"to do""""s.

Recent developments

 Belfast has been successful as the Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography's collaboration of the month. For anyone who's interested in helping to get the article up to FAC standard, there are many resources and a guide available on the UK Geography Project page.

 This Ireland Project is currently being re-vamped in line with the Belfast one.

 Belfast has been nominated as the UK geography project's collaboration of the month. Please feel free to comment and add your vote of support.

 As for your substantive proposal, I agree that significant coverage in multiple sources is the GNG standard, but the sources don't have to be presented before an article can be created.  For example, I created 1892 Harvard Crimson football team knowing that significant coverage exists in multiple sources, but for starting purposes I considered it sufficient to have citations to reliable sources such as the Harvard site and CFDW.  Hopefully, another editor will pick up the baton and expand further, but I don't see how or why an article such as 1892 Harvard should be a candidate for deletion when a search of The New York Times archives of newspapers.com turns up a plethora of coverage for the topic. Stubs are not where we end up, but sometimes they serve a useful purpose in getting things started.

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  

I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  

IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  

1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981 

Jiust to make clear on the last point, that I offered no such argument. Mel Etitis (Talk)

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

Rankings
At the beginning of October, substantial material was added which is mostly critical of the University's recent performance and advertising. With a few tweaks, this material has mostly been accepted on Wikipedia. However, the section on rankings has since then been subject to a slow edit war between the original anon and another. I reproduce the fuller version of the section below for discussion:
In 2010 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand. Its individual global subject rankings were: 212th in Arts & Humanities, 110th in Engineering & IT, 242nd in Natural Sciences, and 152nd in Social Sciences. In 2011 the University of Canterbury slipped from 189th to 212th in these rankings.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5569146/NZ-universities-lose-ground University loses ground. As the 2011 results were released, the University of Canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the VIce Chancellor Dr Rod Carr claims that it ranks among the top 2% of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was assessed.http://www.bsec.canterbury.ac.nz/ Uni in top 2%. Further, the University has promoted itself as being the first university in New Zealand to have been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5708043/Canterbury-University-gets-top-marks Canterbury University gets top marks. Unlike the QS World University rankings, QS Stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee; the programme is designed to give """"...those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students, to stand out and to be recognised for their excellence.http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/qs-stars/ QS Stars.""""
The second anon wishes to truncate the paragraph after the second sentence, ie from """"In 2011"""" onwards. No reason has been given for this. I have suggested that this third sentence remain, since it is purely factual and referenced, but I am less willing to defend the rest of the paragraph which appears to be combining a number of sources to make an argument or inference not directly supported by the sources directly. My proposal is clearly not satisfactory to either of the anons. I welcome their explanations here, and input from other parties.-gadfium """,0

Our First Amendment gives us the right to start a blog and publish whatever we wish to say about anybody.  It is much easier to be critical than correct. 
 
The freedoms we enjoy in the U.S are wonderful but they are also very dangerous. To create an unfavorable impression, it is not necessary that what is said be true.  The damage is done in the mere telling of it.  No one has felt that sting more than I.

See, that's always the way I'd considered it, too (although I'm a Catholic who supports Liverpool). However, the debate still rages fiercely - I used to work at Radio Merseyside on the Roger Phillips phone-in, and it would crop up all the time. As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",0

If you just want my opinion, it seems from the few tussles you and Ramallite have had, you often edit POV bits into the articles, but at the same time Ramallite is incapable of respecting the NPOV facts that you do add or are contained within your edits to the point where his actions are just as bad. An example would be your addition about the number of wells cut off by the barrier (I can't find it now and only recall it somewhat). While some of your addition I remember as strongly POV, there were important facts contained within it such as that the Israel government says that no wells have been cut off. If I remember correctly, Ramallite simply reverted which is not appropriate. Another example I see is part of your recent edit. Some of it I think is POV such as implying all Israelis agree in the first statement, whether you meant """"Israel the government"""" or """"Israel the citizens"""" is unclear. One thing that irked me was Ramallite's reversion of the following addition: """"The Israeli government states that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent the infiltration of terrorists, and that any hardship imposed on Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism."""" This I believe is completely true and you are attributing it so it should be easy to verify. The current version: """"Although the Israeli government has said that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent attacks and that any hardship to Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism, the barrier's opponents say the barrier is the de facto future border of the State of Israel."""" is argumentative and implies the first statement is false and last statement is true as a result of the conditional """"Although"""" which implies contradiction. This is far more POV than your addition. Considering that he says he will continue to work on the articles where you have the dispute I would be inclined to oppose the nomination based on this alone. Additionally he seems condescending towards you, and I'm sure it is difficult to ignore that considering his edits and stay civil (though staying civil would probably help the dispute).

"citation nazi warning 

Look, here's the deal: this website may be a reliable source for the radio frequencies used by some airports in the UK, but it certainly doesn't back up the sweeping generalizations that have been attributed to it recently. I'm assuming that someone confused the nicknames of the sources or something, so I've gone ahead and replaced most citations to that article with  tags in the hope that those people actively seeking out sources will correct their mistakes swiftly.

That said, I feel compelled to warn those involved with editing this article that an editor less inclined to assume good faith might very well think that these incorrect attributions were intentionally misleading, which is a severe violation of Wikipolicy. So for the good of everyone involved in the editing of this article, and of Wikipedia as a whole, I intend to make regular practice of removing new assertions that are unsourced or incorrectly sourced, and bringing the behavior of any editor who persists in adding unsourced/poorly sourced content to this article up for review.

Historical context behind Japanese occupation of Korea is crucial to understanding Karate's influence on the formation of TKD.  Huge parts of TKD culture, history, practice, personalities are heavily influenced by the repressive nature of the colonial period.  Omitting this context would be FACTUALLY misleading.  THis section is about Karate's influence on TKD.  MOST of this influence occurred during colonial times.  I don't see how you can leave out historical context of occupation.  

Dude, this section is about KARATE'S INFLUENCE ON TKD!  According to your logic the whole section needs to be deleted because it's about TKD and NOT karate.  You're not making sense here.

Do you have any thoughts on the subject of tuned circuits for UHF/SHF, I am planning on expanding the page a little to make it more useful.

Can you pleae be more careful when adding material that you dont destroy peoples improvements? BTW can you please sign your posts by typing four tildes so we know who to reply to. Thanks. 

I think that a clear need exists for the division between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines. Many aerials are balanced such as the centre fed half wave dipole, these aerials can be fed using a balanced line which is connected directly to the some old equipment or via a balun in the shack. The other option is to use a balun near the feed point of the aerial and an unbalanced feeder (This arrangement normally leads to higher losses, but it is more EMC friendly). While the use of long runs of balanced feeder is something which many people outside of the radio community are unaware of, it is a concept which is very important and WP will be better if such things are included.

Sorry I overwrote any improvements which another editor made, but I was reverting some changes which had made the lecher line section into dire state where it was not in the correct order. 

Yes but we dont want to turn it into page on Ham radio solely- its about transmission lines. Sounds like we need a page on aerial matching however, aerial feeders (bal and unbal) are I think are appropriate on this page.",0

What if the beam started lower, if the beam, was closer the the S, would more mass go to the S, would there be a point, where it would not split anymore? How many people repeated this experiment?
Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet. How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment, so it needs to be displayed how that is. It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring. When the radiation leaves the mass, it is effected by the tension. This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge. They dont exist.

"Wow! My thought experiment has gotten you all fired up, it seems. -) 
In the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there.
Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted.

 Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? 
 
But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give. 
This theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.) 

Poincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. 
I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. 
Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy. 

In his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.

I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  | Talk",0

"""heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.
My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   
 I completely agree with you dictionary. However the key phrase is """"the scientific study of human populations"""". Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   

Non-families

I notice that a lot of Wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories: """"had children under the age of 18 living with them"""", """"were married couples living together"""", """"had a female householder with no husband present"""", and  """"non-families"""". These categories do not add up to 100%;, for examples see Downers Grove, Willowick, Ohio, etc etc. Any ideas about where this came from, and how it can be addressed? It seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy. Novickas 

Generational Cohorts

Policies, Ritchie333? How about the one I've been quoting all along, that is one of the very foundations of Wikipedia, WP:NPOV?  The best course of action is to follow the core policies.  Write articles in a neutral tone of voice.  Don't report opinions as if they are facts.

 Response. I find it somewhat ironic that you're criticizing me for taking the exact actions you took. I noticed a page which I honestly felt (and still do) does not meet any of the 12 pts. in WP:MUSIC. I have no interest in their music or their entry. I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny.

 I think this is all rather scholastic. The name is admittedly imperfect due to the fact that the article essentially catalogues very recent (by the standards of any encyclopedia) and ongoing events. But the term could be justified: the number 2 therein implies a clear reference to THE Cold War, which evokes unmistakable associations, the prime one being the rivalry exactly between Russia (the USSR) and the US for the global dominance (to put it bluntly). And not just some highly localised and geopolitically irrelevant (unless you watch CNN claptrap on a daily basis) squabble somewhere in the Near East. Russia is the only state that not merely defies the US, but challenges the entire status quo as established post-Cold War, as is clear from Putin's quotes cited in the Background section. There is every sign that he is determined to achieve at least what the USSR had, i.e. dominance over half of the Continental Europe, or to go nuclear in a very literal sense of the term, i.e. obliterating the centres of Western civilisation. This is almost official now. Thus, at the end of the day, Yes, it is about the US vs the RF, as the US is the only military force in NATO to speak of. But the implications thereof are very broad, the phenomenon is nascent, therefore separate article is warranted, I think.

I have seen in this article there is an issue of consensus regarding the name. Let me shed some light on the same:

1) Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra sect, just like Pope is to Christanity. Since calling the Pope, Pope John Paul is allowed in Wikipedia, the name Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin should also be allowed. Here Syedna is the word used instead of Pope. Furthermore just like the Pope, Syedna is also placed before only one person in the world in Dawoodi Bohra community. Just like Pope it indicates leadership. So by not allowing to use it would amount to discrimination on the part of Wikipedia and its editors and administrators and other authorities towards a minority sect. 

2) All the verifications in Wikipedia is done on the basis of media references and in the entire media Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin is refered to as Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin.

I would like to request the editors to please do not confuse yourselves by the issues raised by people with less knowledge regarding this article and resolving the issue of name move ahead and concentrate on improving the content of the article.

(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: 

Wikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called """"volunteer system.""""  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further """"editing"""" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a """"terrible person you are.""""  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.

Below is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:

I guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.

If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.

The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of """"vandalism"""" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw """"vandalism"""" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a """"disarming"""" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.

Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.

I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As",0

 Where do these concepts come from? 

The article was recently revised to say that Old Town is """"in Williamson County, near Franklin"""" (no longer """"in"""" Franklin) and that the mound complex """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""" (no longer simply """"on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""").

I'm puzzled by these changes, which aren't sourced. My investigations (call them """"original research"""") using online maps do indicate that Old Town is in northwestern Williamson County, near Franklin, but not inside the current city limits or even in the urban growth boundary. Thus, I think the geographic location is OK, even though sources have placed it """"in"""" Franklin. 

Let me get this straight.  You want to use insulting language about the edits, but then agree that they are factually correct.  Where is the OR?  I disagree that it is OR to state that the location is in Williamson County.  Whether or not it is currently in the current city limits is a factual matter that I am not actually sure about, but in the historic sweep it is correct to say that the location is near Franklin (think of Franklin having been a small town at one time).  It is """"near"""" Franklin, meaning it is not in modern downtown Franklin.  I see no OR.  

However, I can't agree with """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""". First off, what is later than """"is""""? It appears to me that the mound complex """"is"""" alongside the Harpeth River and """"is"""" on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace. I surmise that the intent was to say that the site was not on a branch of the Natchez Trace when the mound complex was built, but I don't buy that. First off, the previous version of the article never said that the mound complex was built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace; it merely said that it's there now. Secondly, I'm not aware of any source indicating that the mound complex was not built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace. Notwithstanding whatever the current version of the [[Natchez Trace[[ article, it's my understanding (based on diverse sources) that the Trace (which is an interconnected collection of trails, not a single trail) existed for centuries before white people laid eyes on Tennessee, and that archaeologists who have investigated Old Town assume that it was located where it is because of the river, the Trace, and the crossing of Brown's Creek. If the intent was to say that the Trace did not exist when the mound complex was built, I see that as a piece of WP:OR that's inconsistent with many sources.   

Those amendments to the article were in 2 edits, the main one with edit summary """"revise about assertion of location, avoiding unnecessary disclosure and avoiding synthesis (e.g. about 2 creeks being the same, not in a source AFAIK). Drop dup cat."""".  Funny you should be making accusations of original research.  I think the wp:OR accusation should apply more strongly to the previous language, which included wp:OR in the form of synthesis (wp:SYNTH?) about which creek is what (and the synthesis ends up disclosing more about location than is necessary).  I think that """"the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" refers pretty clearly to that branch of the 1800's Natchez Trace, which served as path/roadway for return upstream of persons who had brought rafts or barges down the Mississippi to New Orleans.  The other branch is known as the Ridge Route or something like that and is covered in a different NRHP listing.  These two distinct branches are known in history and described in historical documents, including being described in Williamson County MRA and other documents that Orlady has read.  To refer to the prehistoric mounds having been built along the 1800s-era historic """"Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" is wp:OR, wp:SYNTH, ahistorical, sloppy, generally bad, in poor taste, and whatever else sounds negative, more so than the language which replaced the original language.

OR is bad.  OR was removed by the edits.  OR was not introduced by the edits.  Yay!  Glad we are all agreed.  I am sure there are improvements to the language which can be made, but I would prefer not to argue small wording changes until the bigger article structure questions being discussed above are settled.  Or until Orlady agrees to allowing a third party to judge on wording, and replies about participating in mediation to address the long pattern of conflict. ncram """,0

 Supercategories 

Hi Daniel

I just noticed on the Mariners article seems to have a couple of super-categories, Sport in NSW is a supercat of Football (soccer) in NSW, and Australian football (soccer) teams is a supercat of A-League teams.  It's a minor point but are the supercats necessary if you've already identified more specific cats?   
Ah, yes, you raise a very good point. I must say, categories have never been my strong point; the best example was Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/FIFA World Cup hat-tricks, when I submitted it to FLC without even adding them (I forgot about their existance totally). I have modified the article, as (from my limited category knowledge) you are quite correct. Cheers, and thanks so much for this note, all your other suggestions, and your minor fixes, '''' """,0

The exiled map!

This map is alive only on my personal pages (since I created it) as an exile because of a dispute with 2 bias posters. There attitude was poor and they ultimately both disproved there nonsense and made me leave the U.K. railways in distress. Flaimers? 

The false 'allegations' were-

No time frame- It was on the map's title.

Bias because more accidents coming from English speaking states to the English Wikipedia- If that is of concern, then the Wikipedia article I used as a source is also guilty.

Bias because America has a big and busy railway- India has a world rebound railway, witch is both an example of big and busy! As for the non-stop life of the Japanese, German and British railways!

Noting the un-note-worthy- I literally copied the Wikipedia article in to a map, so that also goes back to say, that if anything, the article needs a good tidy up.

Name your sources- The Wikipedia article it was attached to.

To may variables to decipher- Were they indirectly questioning the whole article’s itegraty, since the map was only a literal coppy of the on-screen text.

Portrayed America in a poor light- If that's so, what about India, they were running a close second for 'Most rail crashes between 1950 and 2006. """"Whats good for the goose is good for the gander"""" as we say in the U.K.

The flamers never noticed-

They did not notice that I have missed of Eritrea's new railway or that Libya dose not have a railway, and said nothing when I corrected the map.

Hi Legolas95, thank you for acknowledging my concern;
In etymology section, user:sitush has previously suggested while replying to another user - to restore the previous content excluding Sadasivan's book reference.  The concerned sentence from this reference was self-explanatory and was not inclined to any side as to why the term Nayar is derived from Naagar.  Please consider the following point also that the Naga point of etymology was not given consideration because of misinterpretation that real serpents have evolved to constitute Nair population - which is entirely false.  I was really mentioning this census report shall stand as an authentic reference for the same.
My second humble suggestion was to consider the caste system in the article.  I would like to invite your attention to the first sentence ie.
""""The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy and in that system outranked even the kings.""""
This sentence at the beginning says about the role of Namboodiri class in Kerala as a whole.  This is not about Nairs or the caste system of nairs.  Here the proposed sentence gives little light on the scene ie.
""""Nairs observed no internal caste system till the Brahmin migration occurred in Kerala.""""
This is not promotional to nairs but it indirectly says Brahmin migration has influenced Nair caste system.  My kind opinion is that it is better to remove present first sentence.
Second sentence says,
""""Bulk of them formed the fighting and protecting class, some of whom became chiefs and Naduvazhis. Some sections of the people were engaged in other occupations also.""""
This actually represent all sides of the community.  Tell me if this sentence seems inclined certainly we shall remove this.
The third sentence I consider as little important:  It says,
""""It is a notable point that long before Aryans migrated southwards, Nairs had travelled far beyond the northern tradition of chathurvarna system and developed a multiplicity of castes.""""
This sentence actually demonstrates that Nair community's social structure is prone to faster development.

I have a request to user:Legolas95 user:Sitush and user:Qwyrxian - In the reference under consideration, there is a sentence claiming that 'there is no evidence that before 18th century (before 1700 AD) the term sudra was ever applied to Nairs.'  If this like a sentence requires verification, we need to consider references created before this period.  What in my mind is that if we be little flexible on the matter of older reference - it can help Nair article.    

These were my concerns regarding this census report which are quite eligible to be considered and provides some help towards improvement in the article.    19:27""",0

"Thank you for your comments Anon. I will mention though that I've been commenting on this and similar pages for a long time, but to little effect; it also tends to result in insults and abuse, so it gets tiresome and I don't come around here every day. I thank you that you are not abusive.
One thing that is needful to attain NPOV is to avoid stereotypes. You've just created one (above) though I doubt that you did it intentionally, as some other editors regularly do. This is the portrayal of the opposition as judgemental, hellfire and brimstone types. This would be characteristic only of the most extreme fundamentalists (like Fred Phelps). It is not characteristic of the majority of conservative Christians; even a lot of fundamentalists would not agree, and are in opposition to those like Fred Phelps.
There are actually these extreme judgemental fundamentalists on both sides of the issue; only the guys in the white hats trade with the ones in the black hats. Witness the pro-homosexuals who use judgemental epithets (even on these talk pages) like bigot and homophobe. To get the page into NPOV we have to get past the stereotypes and the epithets.
A more typical conservative Christian view, and a more fair characterization, would be to think in terms of an owner's manual. If you drive your car disregarding the manufacturer's intructions; i.e. you abuse the car in various ways and don't perform the maintainence on the schedule that manufacturer gives, your car will suffer from it. It's not politically correct to mention, but it's simple and plain truth that homosexuals have shorter life expectancy; in fact promiscuity of whatever flavor will shorten a person's lifespan. You can develop the rest of this line of thought as well as I can. -And that is just physical health.
Because there is a strong pro-homosexual group of Wikipedia editors, who regularly communicate with each other (internal spam) the cluster of pages on the homosexual topics has deteriorated into propaganda pieces, that whitewash the dangers and risks, and paint the opposition in stereotypes/straw men that are easier to attack.",0

About your comments:
01. They had 11 events in 2011 and 10 in 2012. Why would you revise that number upwards? Ten seems to be a good number for a serious organization. JF is the largest organization in Brazil.
02. Jungle Fight had exactly five title fights in 2012. Two in JF 47, two in JF 37, one in JC 36.
03. Their events are shown on ESPN outside Brazil since JF 20. In Brazil, their events started to be shown before that.
04. About their number of fighters, it's better if you keep the rules simple. For example, require that at least 50 fighters fought in the organization in the span of a year. What do you think about that?

I know it seems weird for Jungle Fight to have the same or more points than Strikeforce, but we have other options instead of gaming the system against Jungle Fight. The current way to determine what is a top or second tier organization puts full weight on the rankings, while your system gives minimal weight to it. I think we should find a middle ground, while at the same time keep things as simple as possible. In order to do so, I would scrap criteria 3 and 8, and use a criteria based on rankings determined by Fight Matrix. That criteria could amount to 1/3 or 1/2 of all possible points. The advantages would be that the main organizations would certainly be ahead of other, while at the same time event short lived but notable organizations would have a high score. By using Fight Matrix, we would be able to easily determine how many points defunct organizations would have. Maybe we could present such a system as a possible substitute to the current way we use to determine notability?",0

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku Demographics of Azerbaijan, History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

Yamla, the discussion about her being or not Portuguese has been going on since February. It is about time to put an end to it. Your concern as per WP:MOSBIO means what? Clarify yourself!

""""Nationality (In the normal case this will mean the country of which the person is a citizen or national, or was a citizen when the person became notable.""""WP:MOSBIO

She has two nationalities.Full stop. There is nothing there against it. 

The thing is that your opinion is just POV, for you to sustain that she is predominantly Canadian you need to present sources that states so, I told you that before. Prove she is more Canadian than Portuguese. """"she did not even apply for her Portuguese citizenship until relatively recently """"  Where does it say she applyed for her citizenship recently? I only read she applied for her passport. Read the == Ancestry == section, she is Portuguese from birth. The Rolling Stone is the only source aproved by you? And all the other sources provided  you erased? Like the Portuguese-Canadian National CongressPortuguese-Canadian National Congress  The GuardianNelly Furtado, Loose
There is also The Times I added later: . 
And new ones for you:«""""I think just growing up first-generation Canadian you're so aware of your identity,"""" she said. """"I had my identity as a Portuguese-Canadian. I was very aware, and I already had my ears opened  even singing in another language at such a young age  your ears are already opened to different sounds, different instrumentation, different cultures.»
[""""http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12055995]

What about a Rolling Stone article?""""And though this twenty-two-year-old Portuguese-Canadian singer-songwriter..."""" 

""""Finally, I believe that stating she is Portuguese-Canadian implies that she is Canadian with Portuguese ancestry and such would not be permitted in the intro paragraph according to WP:MOSBIO."""" Is that so? where does it say  in the WP:MOSBIO that a nationality that implies ancestry is not permited? Are there invisible words I have not been able to read?  1-She has Portuguese ancestry because her parents are Portuguese.  Almost all Portuguese have Portuguese ancestry, that way all biographies of Portuguese people would not be permited. 2-She is a European citizen which means for EU countries only her Portuguese nationality is considered, that is, for legal matters.

 Trying to measure the number of cafes

 Solstice
 Cafe Zoe
 The original Allegro (on an alley parallel to the Ave); arguably, its second location in the College Inn also counts
 The Ugly Mug (half block off)
 The Cafe at the corner of 42nd that used to be the Roma, but I can't recall its new name

'Fraid not. This used to happen a while back; either pages for both British English and American English would exist, or more often editors would fight to move a page from one to the other. In June 2005, the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee ruled that """"when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic."""" So since an enterprising Brit got there first, American English words like millimeter and liter redirect to the British English equivalent, but the opposite is true for colour or carburettor.

In the case of geologic map, an American was the first to create the article, so you have to edit that page. However, here's a few suggestions of what you can do:
The text in bold in the opening line should reflect the title of the article. Therefore, since geological map redirects to the page, you can change the first sentence to read """"A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show subsurface geological features.""""
If there's a difference between U.S. and U.K. maps, I'd split the two into separate sections after the opening paragraph, and detail the differences for each (re-ordering the page as I'd done with this edit). If there's no difference, I'd just remove the specific references to the United States as being unnecessary, and expand on what's there.
You can also provide links to British geological maps if such a resource exists, as has already been done for USGS maps.

An explanation of the style ruling can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues and Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English, or if you're really bored you can read the original case at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk, which concerned and edit war over the use of BC or BCE for Biblical dates.

The place for their arguments is either before the entire Circuit Court if it grants a hearing, or before the Supreme Court if it goes there.

Anomalous phenomena

Hey WDM, you did such a great job of pushing parapsychology through to GA and FA status, I was wondering if you'd review another article that I worked on and make recommendations on it. Like a year or two ago anomalous phenomena was the controversial paranormal article of the time and suffered many edit wars, so I rewrote it, drawing quite a bit from the falsification article. It's been sitting there for some time unedited, so it's stable, and (I think) pretty well-written. It probably needs some work, so let me know what you think. Is it GA worthy, potentially FA worthy?

First of all I have nothing against you or Rouvas (who is an artist I actually like) in case there is a misunderstanding. I read the changes and I have to admit that you did a very good job... but I still think you exagerate in general about Rouvas. He's not perfect in everything as the whole bio clearly slows. And the movie Sta Akra (because I live in Greece) was not a BIG box office hit... Don't live in a bubble. And in the article there's only one positive review from Zoumboulakis praising his performance and the movie itself. In this case only one review means that his performance was indeed good and proves a point and many """"random reviews"""" cannot prove that a movie was good or bad in the case of Alter Ego? (and let's face it... it was a really bad movie, but that's my opinion). You repeatedly put info in the Anna Vissi article, stating her commercial decline. Apagorevmeno sold 27.000 units (2x platinum) and it was her lowest selling album. You can't say that. I believe Rouvas' """"Parafora"""" certified double platinum, or am I wrong? I am not sure. But if it's true how many units did he sold. There must be around 25.000 units or more, right? That means it's his lowest selling album, right? If it is I didn't see you writing on his article!!! So, some things apply for Vissi and not for Rouvas. I think it's unfair and you're being highly impartial. Not to mention that Rouvas never made huge sellings (like 7 platinum that Vissi did) but he still is a big selling artist so his decline cannot be that obvious like Vissi and Vandi. (I really hope you get my point and what exactly I'm trying to say to you). So it's not easy or even possible to reach a 7 platinum status again in someone's career and especially in this period. I'm not mad about anything especially for a bad review that concerns Vissi. I'm used to it.

 Your rollback request 

Hello Sionus, I have granted your account rollback in accordance with your request.

Direct from the House of Zig
Suzanne Carbone and Lawrence Money
The Age, November 15, 2006

WHATEVER happened to Zig, the disgraced half of the famous Melbourne clowns? Doug McKenzie, the better half, turned up his curly toes two years ago but Diary has not heard a word about Zig, Jack Perry, until now, although we're none the wiser if he's still with us. Diary had a call from South Melbourne: the Salvos store in Clarendon Street has been selling his stuff. Kitchen chairs, a bedroom dresser with mirror, two bedside cabinets, all optimistically marked: """"heritage"""" and """"Once belonged to Zig the Clown"""".

The lady at the counter said she had never heard of Zig and Zag but the """"men who collected it said that was where it came from"""".

You remember the tragic saga: after four decades of frolicking with the kids, starring in Moomba and on ankle-biter television, Zig and Zag were finally made Moomba monarchs in 1999 but the reign was over before it began. Suddenly it was revealed that, years before, Zig had pleaded guilty to child molestation and he (and, hence, hapless Zag) was dethroned. Zig and Zag never spoke to each other again. If still alive, Zig would be 89 now.

   Hi.  I'm not familiar with Doyle or the topic in general, but perhaps I can give you a sense of whether there should/shouldn't be an article on Doyle. With biographies of living people, there are two hurdles on this Wiki, and they largely overlapverifiability and notability. In both cases, usually the question boils down to this:  are there enough reliable, secondary sources that tell us about the subject that we can read them all, and from those sources alone write a reasonably neutral and factual article? In general such sources are going to be things like newspaper articles, magazine articles and books from reliable publishers, anything with a real editorial staff. No press releases, no use of the fellow's own web site, Facebook page, videos, etc.  For athletes like this it's also possible to fill in additional information from reliable databases of results, but notability really requires articles that discuss the subject in some level of detail. Take a look at [{WP:GNG]], and see if that helps you decide.  looks to be at least one such source,  is a reliable reference but only mentions Doyle in passing.

 Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status 

The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006.

"Hi Mihir. We all understand the complications you're going through. As I said here, an unacceptable burden has been placed on the CAs to make this poorly designed program work. We can be lenient when it comes to writing style, poor English, etc. These issues can be fixed gradually through copyediting, although I have to say that in some cases the English so poor (often resulting from copying text verbatim and then attempting to change individual words or verb tenses, or removing one or two phrases from the sequence) that the text is incomprehensible. Only editors who are subject specialists can copyedit such articles, thus greatly reducing the pool of editors who can make the repairs. Here's an example. The student had had multiple copyvio problems before and asked me to look at the new draft. I could confirm that blatant copyvio doesn't seem to be there anymore, but I simply cannot understand the content enough to fix the English or even comment on its accuracy.However we cannot be lenient on copyright violation, ever. The scale of the problem is now so large that it's now going to take literally months (and many editors) to find and remove it from articles edited by IEP students. The silver lining to this cloud is that we'll probably find and get rid of a lot of other copy vio that didn't come from IEP students. Hardwired control is one example I found today.

Good work on Oyston and thanks for your comments. 

Yes, I actually agree with you about most readers (at least the ones who are ever likely to read about Owen Oyston) wouldn't ever have a clue about what a Baby Bell (or even a Regional Bell Operating company) is; but I also figured that telling them that they are American still doesn't tell the reader anything that substantially affects that lack of understanding. To make much sense of it, I reason that they will still have to look 'Baby Bell' (or 'RBOC') up - and when they do that, then it will be obvious that it is an exclusively US thing.

 Fandom 

Seeing how its gotten to be, I'm surprised at how little its mentioned of. Its even been referred to in article  I'm not saying we should start posting up links to fanart or fanfics (don't care for them), but some things should be made mentioned of.

 Shipping
 Considering its relationship with both the series and fandom definately needs made mention of. Not """"Zomg! Katara and Aang should like totally get together. Kataanger 4ever!"""" Something like:
""""One aspect of the series is the 'shipping' which has come to be one of the franchise's main foundations. This is best expressed by the last Comic Con panel, which included a hilarious slide segment dedicated to identifying each and every one, and then some. The most infamous ship is that of the 'Zutara' ship. As the portmanteau  name implies, the ship involves the characters Zuko and Katara, and was first catalyzed by Zuko tying Katara to a try and attempting to bribe her with the necklace of her deceased mother in 'The Waterbending Scroll'. One way or another, it has grown to be one of the most recognizable ship, and also helping it was the fact that the two voice actors shared a parallel relationship on another show, 'American Dragon Jake Long'. Regardless of it origins, due to being known to regularly visits their fansites and forums, the creators are quite aware of the ship or at least seem to enjoy playing with it, as it has been mentioned in almost every interview/convention. Also evident is the fact that the very first commercial clip for the season two finale centered around informing viewers that the two were to be 'spending some unexpectesd time together'""""

Now as a person who doesn't ship for any show, as it has a knack for getting in the way of the plot and true characterizations and this show's no different (Sokka's role in Lake Lagoi for example), I'm surprised their isn't even some little line like """"For one reason or another, numerous fans have enjoyed pairing blank with blank ever since their interaction in the waterbending scroll in complete disregard of the natural intial unliklihood. Some are thoroughly convinced that the two will 'end up together' """" somewhere in their trivia section. 

 Once again fanart and all that other crap shouldn't be put here but there are some who should be made mentioned of. Kimberly Miranda aka """"Isaia"""", ...aka Aviaq's satirical take on the Avatar fandom has earned her mention in articles and recognition in the eyes of the staff. (she was right on the money with that one) To go even further, recently the deviantart user """"rufftoon"""" known best for lighthearted Avatar based strips, has been enducted as a storyboader for the series. Seriously  

 Finally in terms of media. Avatar fanvids and online episodes have come to be quite common on youtube, even earning some """"most viewed"""" honors, but are constantly deleted because of copyright issues. Though common for most youtube vids, problems arose with the Google Youtube deal  and have reached a headway. In that tens of thousands of vids were once again removed, and due to Avatar's relations to Viacom, it was affected.  The staff once even expressed their sympathy and support for the production of the videos.

""""We did remove the illegal episode broadcasts but the mashups are great. Everybody at Avatar loves them. I have also noticed that some of them have been removed. However it is not by us. Most likely it is the record companies pulling the content because of the music that is used. 

Google is cracking down on a lot of this now that they have bought youtube. 

We still encourage mashups and videos to the fullest."""" 

Naturally all this crap doesn't have to go on the main page, could just have a link to its page, like with the media information. Come to think of it, fits well under the “franchise” category. Doesn't even have to all be crammed in one place like this, it just calls for some mentioning here and there, ya'know. Heart of series. More or less.""",0
"""
Can anyone doubt that Arab refusal to recognize the Jewish state was the cause of the Six-Day War? Pre-war rhetoric was fill with blood-curdling chants of """"itbach al-yahud"""" or """"slaughter the Jews."""" This mantra was repeated over and over. Moreover, there was no """"occupation"""" before the Six-Day War. Yet the Arabs, led by Egypt, still called for """"throwing the Jews into the sea."""" So the question is why? why would they want to throw the Jews into the sea if there was no """"occupation."""" the reason stems from the fact that the source of the conflict has nothing to do with the so-called """"occupation"""" and everythingg to do the persistent Arab refusal to recognize a so-called """"foreign implant"""" or Western dhimmi presence in the """"plundered soil of Palestine."""" Therefore, this edit  is accurate and adds balance. In truth, I'd rather see the entire sentence that precededs it, The status of the Israeli-occupied territories and the concurrent refugee problem, are central concerns in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, raising issues in international law, and having far-reaching consequences in global affairs, removed per the concerns raised by Cptnono. Also, it constitutes WP:SYNTH. It is summary opinion that doesn't belong and it is not encyclopedic. So I propose that either my edit be allowed to remain or in the alternative, the entire aforementioned sentence be removed.  """,0

I asked you to prove you can't appeal an ITN decision, not whether you had ever seen it done or not. The appeal venue is obviously the talk page, or I suppose the talk page of the person who made the decision. I went to the talk page, and nobody said I couldn't appeal, they just rejected it out of hand. If I contravened the no appeal rule, they're certainly being very coy about it. And quite obviously it doesn't take 7 days to figure out if a decision was wrong - and in case you hadn't noticed, 4 days later and Gerry Adams is still under arrest, and it's still in the news, so even in this case, I'm sure if Wikipedia wasn't such a dysfunctional place, the veracity of the original decision could have been examined exhaustively by now.

It's pretty obvious what I would have liked to hear from you, but I suppose intentionally ignoring people is the way of Wikipedia. This situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it deleted for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it). And I've already given you extensive reasons why 'write it yourself' isn't really going to cut it as a solution. I'm not going to write it, and neither are they. Nobody is going to. Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a passable first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. Me, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so crap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively documented). Which merely leaves me still wondering why any of you think this sort of approach would motivate me, or anyone else who realises this is the way of Wikipedia, to fix/write the articles for you. You must really think people are fools.   17:46",0

I have no particular axe to grind with the ACLU, but on reading some of the comments on this discussion page I noticed one that said the founder was a Communist.

It certainly coloured my view of the organisation, and I feel it would help to bring an insight into its formation.  Yet this is not mentioned in the article.  Surely this is pertinent, given the progressive, almost anarchic, political leanings of the organisation past and present?

 Unholy Aliance  
I see that a group of wiki users, greeks I presume, are undoing my edits repeatedly. I fear these greeks have clearly a megali idea ultranationalist agenda which they are pursueing thoroughly and roughlessly. My experience is limited since I am new to wikipedia, hence I would like to invite the admins to take the necessary counter-measures. 
Back to the article, the Greek or Vlach toponym are totally superfluos, since neither of these languages is official in Albania, nor there is any indigeneous greek or vlach speaking community in the city. So far not a single source has been brought to  attest the countrary. Let alone the sentence of being centre of greekness is at least ridicuous. As une user has written precedntly """"The city itself is almost entirely Albanian populated with the Greek minority living in the adjacent villages(namely Dropul, Droviani etc.). The city itself gave birth to a number of Albanian nationalists, artists and politicians(most notorious being Enver Hoxha). The city itself was built under the Ottoman period and shows architecture typical of the Ottoman Empire and formed part of what was unofficially recognized as Arnavutluk. Before then it was nothing more than a fortress that from the 14th century onwards passed from one Albanian tribal lord to another."""" As it is seen here  in the diary of John Cam Hobhouse of his travels with Lord Byron in 1810s Gjirokastra is refered as a  city inhabited by Turks e.i. moslems.

Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others.

Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go.

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """,0

Macedonians
Hi Realek, sorry if I didn't awnser yesterday, but you seemed a bit angry with me, so I decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down. Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I'll try to awnser your points: 
Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed.
The first part was already there: """"Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia."""" As for the second part, """"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed"""", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were """"invented"""" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it.
Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group
I think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it's only stated that """"Greek Macedonians"""" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans.
Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia
I think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had been
There was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance.
Honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can't help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don't know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia.
In conclusion remember that I only edited Telex's text, without adding new statements.
In my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth's Macedonian Question or Poulton's Who are the Macedonians.
As for Telex, you should remember that it's a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it's a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long. Ciao ;-) """,0

"I suspect that it is you with some hidden reasons are trying to blacklist the best poems site

Someone is spamming the site 'best poems' from various different IP addresses over many months. It is a generic commercial poetry site that generates revenues from advertising and offers links to poetry text. It offers no unique value. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] There are many more examples of spammed articles, mostly American.

 The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is """"British & Irish Isles"""". Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.

Did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? 
 
Completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople. 
 
A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now """"Greek islands"""" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated """"Greek"""" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.

 What Makes a Person Notable? 

After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's """"Notable People"""" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him """"famous"""" as well as detractors who consider him """"infamous"""".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   """,0

 Romeo and Juliet comparison 

This is the quote I found from the source given (the other source seems to be a dead link):
""""""""Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean,"""" said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. """"We took from the best.""""""""

I see this has been discussed before and there doesn't seem to be a conclusion, so let me give my two cents. The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world, and that's the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet. There's an enormous difference - Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, for one. Let's just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.

Moreover, if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare, you will know that Shakespeare created nothing. His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name, which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid, who probably heard the story as a folktale. His other tragedies - Hamlet, King Lear - are the same. The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse. It has nothing to do with creativity, and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeare's plot - which has been around for centuries. It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on.

All this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Borden's claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet - is it babbling, or is he simply ignorant? We do not know. But we do know that his comparison is, at best, doubtful. Yes, it is a verifiable source, it comes from the writer's own mouth, and it is not my place to judge him wrong, but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writer's mouth - as far as I know, no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way. I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as """"The writer of the play claimed that..."""" as it is not exactly a notable claim either (nowhere else in the article is it mentioned, except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence). Or, better, remove it.   
I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient. I'd be a little dubious because; besides it being possibly self-promotion, the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that (like what you said about the Bard) they weren't that creative.    

Ok - I have now posted 5 more references not from the author, but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements. I also fixed the dead link. I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same (or similar) description.  As to the obvious similarities: meeting at a party, a balcony scene, each has their """"gangs"""", the thwarting of a parents will, rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics. May this be the end to this conversation now? Thanks for allowing me to post more references.  Please read them all and you might learn something.  
Oh yes - of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story - They too were based on elements of the R&J; story. I feel silly even having to point this stuff out, but it keeps coming up. Let's see - Grease wasn't a tragedy either (except its message of """"dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted"""".  Shakespeare created nothing? Gee, I guess that is why R&J; is perhaps the most adapted play of all time. See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired.  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet (I have though - has anyone on this page read it?). I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have. And just so you know - Shakespeare did indeed add to the plot and created characters that hav",0

 Trinity 

Hi, Mark! I'm not committed to any particular wording.

They would admit, of course, that the term """"Trinity"""" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as """"The Angel of the Lord"""" and the """"Word of Yahweh"""" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, """"some"""" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way. What we do want to do is to either find language that includes them all or that sets forth the multiple positions on the subject. Peace in the Prince of Peace, Bob  Wyneken(talk) """,0

Impacts the 2010 Midterm Congressional Elections has on the 
Presidential Election in 2012
TABIn the 2010 midterm congressional elections, the Republican party took control of the House while the Senate remains a Democrat majority. With the House being in control by the the Republicans, it is going to be difficult, if not impossible to pass legislation without some sort of compromise. With the economy at a low and the unemployment rate still high, the people of The United States are looking for government help to strengthen the economy. President Obama has tried to strengthen the economy with the $800 million dollar stimulus bill. Matt Bai, a New York Times reporter, states in his article about the President, Debt-Busting Issue May Force Obama Off Fence, “And in virtually every case, he has satisfied pretty much no one.” With the 2012 presidential election in two years, both parties will need to gain the approval of the American people to succeed in the election.
TABThe outcome of the 2010 midterm congressional election shows that the 2012 presidential election will be based upon which party can demonstrate that they are going to help the economy grow and act upon the self-interests of the people.
TABMany are attempting to draw upon historical context to predict the outcome of the next presidential election. Some people believe that Obama will be a one term President. Marc Pascal, a writer for The Moderate Voice in: economy, law, politics, and society, states in his opinion piece, Obama will be a one-term President, “2010 is not a parallel to 1994, 1894, or to any other noteworthy year identified by various pundits across the political spectrum. What worked sufficiently well in the 1980’s and the 1990’s for Presidents Reagan and Clinton will not be appropriate for the myriad of challenges facing our nation in 2010 and beyond.” Pascal relates Obama to be more like Presidents Hoover and Carter who were “one-term” Presidents. Pascal compares President Obama with Hoover by stating, “The start of the Great Recession began before the presidential elections.” Pascal looks back with President Hoover and relates his presidency with Obama's, “Contrarily President Hoover was elected before the 1929 collapse and his efforts, over the next 3 years were wholly unsuccessful in extricating the U.S. from a deep and structural Depression. This huge failure naturally resulted in the 1932 election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Democrats running things for the next 16 years.”  
TABIn Pascal's analysis, he concluded that looking back to President Hoover's presidency as well with President Carter's presidency, Obama would suffer the same fate as they did by only serving one term as president. However, not everyone agrees with Pascal's conclusion. Historical analysis shows that this can swing in Obama's favor.
TABUsing the opposite argument, you could say that President Clinton took a huge blow in the 1994 midterm elections of his presidency with a loss of 52 House seats along with eight Senate seats, thus putting Clinton's Presidential agenda in jeopardy. With President Clinton's popularity down in the 1994 midterm elections, President Clinton was able to meet halfway with the Republican legislature allowing him to win the 1996 presidential election. Also in 1938, the biggest loss in midterm election history, President Franklin D. Roosevelt lost 71 House seats and six Senate seats. With Roosevelt suffering tremendous losses in his 1938 midterm election, he was still able to run and continue in office for his third and fourth terms. Another President  who won re-election after a huge blow in the midterm election is Harry Truman. President Truman lost 45 House seats and 12 Senate seats during the 1946 midterm election but still won re-election in 1948. With President Obama loosing a historical 63 House seats and six Senate seats in the 2010 midterm elections, history shows it does not mean President Obama will loose re-election in 2012 due to losses in the last midterms.
TABThe economy in the United States is currently at a standstill. With President Obama signing the stimulus bill, the free-falling economy was saved from further peril. People in The United States are not satisfied with the way that Obama is handling the economy. Updated on December 1, 2010 Obama has approval ratings of 25 percent strong support, but he still faces a high 42 percent disapproval (Rasmussum Reports). With Obama having such a high percentage of those against his policies, he will need to attempt to meet with the Republicans halfway on upcoming legislation. At this moment in time Obama is having little luck compromising with the Republicans. Tamara Lytle quotes President Obama in an AARP bulletin, “We're going to need to work together — Democrats and Republicans and independents — to get it all done. But, you know what,",0

"I think you should differentiate between the mechanism of evolution and the historical evolution. On the one hand not only the basic mechanisms of evolution (variation by mutation, natural selection...), but also the whole mechanism of evolution can be observed. Not nearly as easily as gravity, but it can be observed. (Maybe here the example of antibiotic resistance would be a better, more verifiable example than the fruit flies) Still the mechanism of evolution is only a theory explaining observations which were intuitively called 'evolution'. Those observations are facts (here you got evolution as a fact). The explanation by the mechanisms of evolution is not. It is a theory by definition. On the other hand the theory of historical evolution explaining the variety of species can't be observed, because it is supposed to have happened in the past. You can only observe Fossils and the current flora and fauna. Then you can try to explain how all this came into being; for example by assuming a random abiogenesis of a single cell and then applying the mechanism of evolution. This random abiogenesis and the following evolution over millions of years is what a layman thinks of as 'evolution'. This certainly is 'only' a theory. It isn't and never will be a fact. It is very importent to clearly differentiate these things. Strictly speaking even the assumption that everything always falls downwards cannot be considered a fact. How can you know that there will never be a stone being observed falling upwards?? This may seem a bit like I'm splitting hairs, but if you don't strictly apply well defined terms of 'fact' and 'theory' you will end where we where a few centuries ago considering it a fact that we live on a flat earth. Don't ever hesitate to present things very differentiated! Maybe referencing the critical rationalism by Karl Popper would be a good idea, too.",0

Main points AGAINST this article (RfC)
Information that shows irregularities, tendentious editing, vandalism and POV on this article should written here:
I will start from what looks to be the main problem. 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians. It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article. So the first sentence of the article: Albanian nationalism (also known as Albanianism[1][2][3][4][5] or Pan-Albanianism[6][7]) refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania (1945-1991), its continuation into modern Albania, as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV. Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania... it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride. 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say: """"The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land of'the Dardanians and thus a re-creation of their ancient kingdom"""" is a POV. Here are references that beg to differ One, Two, Three and Four. For more read Kosovo.

"""Ok, he seems to be referring to Kosovo, but he is NOT referring to a preparation/pretext/argument for war.  He is referring to Milosevic's election.  I don't believe that you can use it in an 'argument for war' section.

I feel that I am compromising too much, since the entire criticism is based on a few mentions of the word genocide.  Much more often the term """"ethnic cleansing"""" was used, and the rest of the sentence you cut from the article, all of which is verifiable, """"and all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes, and all those little girls were raped, and all those little boys were murdered,"""" describes ethnic cleansing perfectly.  Are the few uses of the word 'genocide' indicative of the case made by the Clinton administration, or were the much more frequent references to ethnic cleansing the pillar of the argument?  I would say it was certainly the latter, but because he merely uttered the term genocide, proving my point would be a book-length endeavor.  I had not addressed this up until now because I have been acting under the assumption, and increasingly so, that you are writing with a partisan agenda.

""""Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a one-man Pennsylvania """"minority report"""" published after the ratifying convention [cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs, with selected quotation from the """"minority report""""].""""

Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable).

Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil.

Or Slawomir Kapralski, """"Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism."""" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

"Hi again Antandrus.  I agree with your point two, of course - I mean that sincerely.  My problem is that I've been editing anonymously for a while, I really don't know how long, and time was that I didn't have any problems with people randomly and arbitrarily undoing my work.  At some point this began to happen.  It is incredibly offensive.  In fact, to me, it is much more offensive than if someone called me a cunt.  The first time, I assumed it was an isolated incident, but then it happened again... and again... and again.  At least 10 times, and perhaps 20 times or more, my edits have been reverted, often with no explanation, and sometimes with accusations of vandalism.  It's been many months since the first time.  And whether you take a polite tone, or you just mouth off at everyone, the end result is exactly the same.  I have seen probably three or maybe four editors, yourself included, who have taken what I thought was the obvious view that you shouldn't arbitrarily revert IP edits, and I have seen at least ten times as many editors who revert arbitrarily, and plenty who invent post-hoc justifications for their actions.
These arbitrary reverts are a real slap in the face.  I get more satisfaction out of responding viciously than I would out of responding politely, and the end result is exactly the same.  It's very, very depressing to see how reasonable, sensible people like yourself became the minority.  Believe me, if you were the majority, I would not be viciously slagging off anyone.
My IP will change at some point, I don't force it to but it does.  I have no respect for the blocks that result from me being accused of vandalism, so I ignore them.  And I keep on trying to improve articles, and eventually, the same will happen.  So be it.  190.45.54.212",0

 Johanna Harwood and Take Over

I don't think I'm the one most in need of a lecture about not seeing the forest for the trees.

Look, Duk, if you want to take on the job of my reeducation, I can probably talk to you about it.  

But if you want to do so, first we need a solid foundation on which to build the discussions.  Let's stick to what is known about why I was blocked, okay?
JzG blocked me because I complained, in a point incidental to a separate complaint, on a complaints noticeboard, that Rlevse was rude and inconsiderate in his actions towards me.  We know that because JzG came right here and said that was why he was blocking me.
Rlevse blocked me because I had not responded on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts.  We know that because he came right here and said that was why he was blocking me.
We also know it because Rlevse went to WQA and said that was why he was blocking me.
Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at Wikipedia talk:Call a spade a spade.
Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at User talk:ArielGold

Now, maybe I just missed it, but I don't think there is anything at Wikipedia:Blocking policy saying that the decision to block is something entirely at the administrator's whim, or that the administrator should
Block now.  You can always invent a reason for it later.
or anything along those lines.  So let's just stick with what is actually known and knowable about he reason for which I was blocked, the things that had been documented and recorded in our various histories here at Wikipedia before I was blocked.  Anything else is irrelevant.

Don't invent new reasons for a block.  At the same time, don't say that the stated reasons for a block were not the reasons for it.

For that matter, if Rlevse had wanted to take on that job, and had felt that there was something he wanted to teach me, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  He did not do so.  If JzG had wanted to take on that job, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  But he took it one step further than Rlevse did; JzG did make a comment addressed to something I said, but then he blocked me to prevent me from responding to his own comment.   22:13",0

 Editorial issues 

There are points where Highsmith betrays her lack of familiarity with 1980s New York City. I'd like to find a source that comments on this.

No New Yorker has ever ordered a """"white coffee"""" or handed someone a """"fiver"""" or written """"The Bronx"""" with a capital T. By the 1980s the police were not """"the fuzz"""", even ironically, and Chelsea is Chelsea or perhaps the Chelsea neighborhood, never """"the Chelsea district"""". The video arcade where Ralph works is on Eighth Avenue in the 80s, which doesn't exist, since that's Central Park West. Then, without explanation, it's on Broadway in the 80s.

Taken in a broader context, that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living.  Did Carter really smile broadly and instantly?  Did Ronald Reagan really say """"Well"""" at the beginning of sentences?  Where would we be without Dana Carvey and Rich Little?  Obviously, this is an issue that both you and I feel strongly about.

 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, History of rome empire. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Roman Empire#History. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Roman Empire#History - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.   said Zebedee """,0

 Sourcing

A fifty-year old German-language journal article is more than a tad inaccessible, making it problematical as a general reference  as even if you could get your hands on it, a non-fluent-German reader would have difficulty browsing it to see where it says what.

Thank you for your reasoning on KV55. I can't say I disagree with it though I thought including a reference to the difficulties of using modern forensics to date ancient mummies was useful...to illustrate how impossible it was to claim the mummy was just a young person when he died. The Gabolde note, though is quite correct since it does place undue weight on the views of one scholar when there are so many differing views on the KV55 king. Thanks for pointing out that Waenre was actually part of Akhenaten's titulary. Gabolde certainly knew this but I did not. I thought it was another epithet like Meryamun. Yes, I really can't see who else the KV55 mummy can be except Akhenaten; this could be settled if modern forensics didn't give us so strange results for the Egyptian mummies.

As an aside, you are quite right that wiki is not perfect. It has several flaws...the chief one being vandalism and then WP:OR contributions by some crackpots. (yes Hatshepsut's article was vandalized again) But there are a few plusses: at least, with wiki, one can create articles on many fairly obscure temples or archaeological sites such as Trajan's Kiosk, Amada, Temple of Beit el-Wali or Kiosk of Qertassi. In every case, I created the articles and managed to source images for them from flickr users who were happy to see them used on Wikipedia. I hope you like them. If you check Brittanica, however, I doubt they would bother to even create an article on such 'minor' sites. Thank You,",0

 Referencing 

I'm beginning to feel that the improved article would benefit from using the """"sfn"""" template refs. The advantage of these is that they allow precise page numbers to be used for each ref, but at the cost of an extra click being required to get through to the full ref, and any online text of it. The majority of the refs here need updating, and there is an excellent set of very recent papers (several above etc). Some are long and cover large parts of the subject: eg Wolfgang et al. """"Recent Progress..."""" is 24 pages of text, really too long to refer to without page numbers. Equally one doesn't want to clutter up the references section with the full title details up to 20 times.  

I must say I've never used the sfn templates before, though I normally prefer plain short footnotes for the reasons above. See Help:Overview_of_referencing_styles#Shortened_footnotes here for an explanation of how they work.

John: As you know the lead-in sentence for this article is In mathematics, a bivector is a quantity in geometric algebra that generalizes the idea of a vector. That is, this article in WP is about the bivector in geometric algebra (although it could be redesigned to deal with tensor algebra, I suppose, which topic is presently an afterthought at the end). As such, the section on Vector algebra is a subheading of the main topic, the bivector in geometric algebra. Consequently, the reference to the pseudovector in this subsection should make note of the predominant usage in texts on geometric algebra, namely that the bivector in 3D is the pseudovector, just another example of the (n-1) grade multivector being the pseudovector. No? Do you disagree about the common usage?

On that basis it is not exactly a mis-statement but certainly an easily mis-read statement in the article that says: in geometric algebra axial vectors are usually interpreted as bivectors. In fact, what is usual and less open to misconception is  Ławrynowicz """"Hence in 3D we associate the alternate terms of pseudovector for bivector, and pseudoscalar for the trivector"""".

 Ka Sesotho 

Kgotso, ntate McDonald.

Thanks for your input at the Sesotho talk page. I guess it really does depend on one's experiences but I do believe that there are numerous rational justifications to use the names """"Sesotho"""" and """"Basotho"""" (eg. ambiguity of """"Sotho"""" which could refer to half a dozen different things) but I feel that the most important reason is that one should use the original form of the native name instead of arbitrarily modifying it (especially for a name which is not commonly used by average English speakers).

I am rather intrigued by how you peace corps guys manage to learn these languages so quickly and be able to use them in the countries.

What exactly do the peace corps do, exactly? Judging from the film """"eLollipop"""" it appears that it's mainly an international volunteer organisation that goes to poor countries to attempt to uplift the people at grassroots level  which sounds like a lot of fun (yes, I probably SHOULD take a look at the Wikipedia article and stop asking you this stuff).

We agree that there are human rights that do not appear in any law book, treaty, dictionary, or even a USSC decision. The founders of the US said this, and wrote an expandible constitution.

This happened when Congress enumerated such rights with the Civil Rights Act of 1963 (from the Republican Party) and more recently with the Americans with Disabilities Act. I expect that you will see some more """"enumerations"""" by Congress. The US Constitution is designed with the idea that as society progresses that human rights will continue to be """"enumerated"""". I can remember when there was no right of privacy, but Roe v.

Aztec dreadlocks?

Tentatively removed:

Dreadlocks were also part of Mexican culture. In a description of an Aztec ritual, Historian William Hickling Prescott referred to dreadlocked Priests of the Aztec civilization, a Mesoamerican people of central Mexico in the 14th, 15th and 16th century. """"On the summit he was received by six priests, whose long and matted locks flowed disorderly over their sable robes, covered with hieroglyphic scrolls of mystic import. They led him to the sacrificial stone, a huge block of jasper, with its upper surface somewhat convex."""" (William H. Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico)

The Aztecs may, indeed, have worn dreadlocks.  However, the quote provided refers to only """"matted locks,"""" which certainly are not the same as dreads.

"Gaulish language
The answer to your question in Gaulish language is that the so-called Vulgar Latin, which should be called a Latinized Italo-Celtic idiom instead because the spoken language of the Romans (Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic language and not Latin, already essentially a written language) the 'Proto-Italian' was so similar to the Continental Celtic languages that only the lexicon and the pronunciation differed a bit, and could almost be considered a dialect of Gaulish as it contained the same substratum, unlike the Insular Celtic languages. 

So, in reality no one can assert that Gaulish is an extinct language because we don't know enough about it before the Roman conquest and probably many 'Latin' words were already used by the Gauls before their first contact with the conquerers. At the most 'assimilation' could better describe what happened to that language. Both, the Proto-Italics and the Proto-Celts (Veneti) originally come from the Bell-Beaker culture and lived in a dialect continuum for a long time. In fact, Celtic is more a culture (brought by a Thraco-Cimmerian aristocracy) than a language family except for Brythonic and Gaelic languages which are both quite different from each other because of their respective substratum as mentionned above. Moreover, Proto-English (or Proto-Frisian) spoken by the Belgae was already used in Britain as well as in some parts of northern Gaul (Gallia Belgica) by the time of the Roman invasion, then the Belgic tribes just kept speaking the same language during and after the Roman time.",0

"""==Rory==

Is her son reading PPE, Modern History, or Modern History and Politics (MHP)? All three have been mentioned (including the non-existent """"history and politics and history""""). It is sometimes the case that an admissions tutor might suggest that a candidate accepts a place for a subject other than that for which he or she has applied, although I think that is most likely to happen when the candidate has applied for a Joint School and is thought to be better suited to just one of the subjects it includes, e.g. an applicant for Philosophy and Theology might be offered Theology (there is no School of Philosophy); I suppose it is possible that it was doubted whether he was suitably qualified to read the philosophy and economics aspects of the course and, since there is no School of Politics, it would be possible only to offer a Joint School including politics, of which the only one currently offered is MHP (presumably he would have been considered well qualified for Modern History). It isn't the case that PPE is more """"coveted"""" (or even """"coverted""""!) than MHP; rather, that more applicants aspire to read it. I suppose those applicants (and later those who were unsuccessful) do covet reading PPE, but I imagine that MHP applicants covet a place to read MHP. Perhaps PPE is quantitively more coveted, but I think that unless MHP students secretly covet the opportunity of reading PPE, it isn't really an appropriate description. All that might be said is that PPE is long-established and is currently thought to be a good preparation for future life. When the PPE School was in its infancy it was regarded as a very poor School, though not as poor as English Language and Literature, about which it was commonly asked whether one could really justify a university teaching English literature (English language was less controversial, which is why the early course placed such great emphasis on language rather than literature) - one might say that English was the old media studies. Today, English is considered one of the most respectable university degree subjects. Modern History used to be considered second after Literae Humaniores and is still a highly respected School (in fact, all Schools at Oxford are highly respected, notwithstanding criticism sometimes directed against Classical Archaeology and Ancient History). Presumably the earlier information about Rory Campbell reading MHP was incorrect, or he has managed to change his course, which is not uncommon, although it would seem strange for a student to be allowed to change to a course for which he or she had previously been rejected.

Is it actually important to mention that Fiona Millar's son is reading PPE at Balliol? Many hundreds of people have read PPE at Balliol, so it is hardly a thing of any interest in itself. Perhaps if Fiona Millar had previously been an opponent of PPE (very unlikely), or of Oxford (or Oxbridge) (a distinct possibility), or indeed of Balliol (unlikely but a remote possibility), it would be of interest. However, nothing in the article suggests that she holds, or has ever held, anti-Oxford/Oxbridge views. If the suggestion being made was that her son had gained admission to Balliol because of the importance of his parents and in spite of being """"widely regarded as a top class idiot"""", I would think that the allegation is unkind, probably unfounded, and almost certainly impossible to prove. The only way in which it could be included here would be if it was stated in some other source, such as a newspaper article.

Podczas składania kwiatów pod Pomnikiem Czynu Powstańczego uczynili oni gest pozdrowienia poprzez podniesienie prawej ręki. Geneza tego gestu sięga Cesarstwa Rzymskiego. Był to tzw. „rzymski salut” stosowany podczas powitania cesarza. Gest ten przejęli później włoscy faszyści, a następnie faszyści niemieccy, którzy unosząc w górę prawą dłoń jednocześnie wypowiadali słowa: „Heil Hitler”.

Zgodnie z pkt 5 rozdziału I statutu: „ONR może używać odznak, pieczęci i innych symboli na zasadach określonych w przepisach szczegółowych”.

I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.

But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA; i.e. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and especially Shaq. Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players. If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.

The following articles have a lot of duplication with Japanese grammar. Either Japanese grammar should be sensibly sliced up and distributed, or these articles should be merged here.

 Japanese verb conjugations

Why do you want to merge this page into the already over-long Japanese grammar? This page is intended to be a comprehensive reference list of verb conjugations in Japanese. It will make Japanese grammar too long. The tables on Japanese grammar are illustrative, and the tables on Japanese verb conjugations are comprehensive.   

 Japanese consonant and vowel verbs

Don't merge this page. It is a reference page where I am going to put the lists from the sci.lang.japan FAQ. Please see the link.  

—  

 I want to merge them because there is needless duplication. I would be happy to discuss how to divide up Japanese grammar into a collection of smaller but more focused articles. Incidentally, please respond below instead of interspersing your responses, which makes the flow of dialogue impossible to follow. —  

 First you put a sign on the article I wrote suggesting a merge, and then you say you want to discuss breaking up the Japanese grammar article into smaller pieces, which is a contradiction. Please decide what you want to do before you start sticking merge signs on pages.  

 The merge is still the suggested course of action. Anyway, it appears that arguing with you would be fruitless. Do whatever you wish. —  

Thank you for your permission. I find the current """"Japanese grammar"""" article very hard to grapple with. There seems to be a lot of detail in some places and then great big gaps in other ones. For example there are lots of examples about """"jibun"""" and """"are/sore/kore"""" but on the verbs it says very little relatively speaking, and there is lots of rather dense stuff about historical Japanese and """"sumite"""" becoming """"sunde"""", and the use of the names like """"renyoukei"""" and """"kami ichidan doushi"""" which actually don't mean very much - basically it has too much terminology. I was originally thinking of editing  Japanese grammar into what I thought would be a better form, but after a few trial edits and test questions I felt rather concerned about the response I would get, so I decided to avoid trouble by doing minor edits only on the Japanese grammar page and creating supplementary articles for the things I wanted to add. I would like to aim for simplicity and unity and focus in the supplementary articles. I hoped it would be a reasonable compromise, and here even you suggest splitting the Japanese grammar page, but if you object to the articles I have made I suggest detailing the problems rather than merging. Also I wonder why you thought of merging my pages, when the page Japanese language has a grammar section which is extremely bloated, and really does need to be merged into Japanese grammar. If you want to merge something, I would suggest the most in need of merging is the great mass of untamed and unfocused edits on Japanese language#Grammar rather than my modest pages which are fairly well-focused and form a valuable supplement to this page in my opinion.

 Stem forms 

Hello, I wonder if there was some particular reason why the order of the stem forms does not follow the standard order of 未然・連用・終止・連体・仮定・命令?  Anything I read about these six forms always states the forms in that order (and if it is classical Japanese, 仮定 is replaced by 已然, the perfective), and in fact dictionaries simply state the six forms of a particular verb etc. in that order without specifying which is 未然, 連用 etc.  I think the forms here should be put in this standard order.   03:03, 2005 May 13 (UTC)

I'm being subject to harassment by two administrators, User:Slimvirgin and User:Jayjg (among other users), who object to my editing and are trying to drive me off the Wikipedia with persistent interference, factitious objections and POV censorship.

 Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions 

I am not and was never looking to start trouble, all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.

The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on.

My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown/Slam.

You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so.

On 8-4-06, JBL said he was a Slam winner.  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat.

It was said that no outside source has verified this, but no one in WWE has disputed JBL's claim either.

Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal.

When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW, the I-C and U.S. Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions.  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw (I-C) and Smackdown (U.S.).

PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a """"World Title"""" and their word is law here on Wikipedia.

They also have always maintained that the I-C and U.S. Championships are of equal value and of equal standing.

As I have said before, I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia, only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact, based on logic and references.

JBL, PWI, and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. (Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page).

All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one.

Thank you for your time.

pho·bi·a (fō'bē-ə): A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangeroushttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phobia.

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.

"""::::You're assuming far more about my views than I've actually said. I have two related points. First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

 To conclude, whilst there legitimate arguments for doing so, we don't have to """"wade into the mud"""" of self-identity, and basic encylopaedic principles demand that.

Well, first let me say that if you have any questions about wiki-formatting, just drop me a line, and I'll be happy to help. As for the glossary, I think there's a better way. Remember, as an encyclopedia, it would be better to have articles about each of the terms, and then put the terms into a category so they would all be grouped together.

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.
Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.

Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.

Sorry and thanks again. Feel free to contact me any time you need.

"A consistent conceptualization of phylogenies 
Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.

(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )",0

"No Anome, what matters is the correct matching up of the maths to physical reality, and the polar coordinate system is the one that is tailor made to deal with concepts such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force.

The centrifugal force is a radial effect and the Coriolis force is a tangential effect.

But before we can use the expressions in polar coordinates we must construct a physical model of a real situation and then construct a differential equation around it, usually in the scalar variable of radial distance. 

If you were in the slightest genuine about this topic, you would have read the section which I added to the main article yesterday. You would have blocked PeR for vandalism and wikistalking for having erased it on specious grounds.

It hardly needed sourced since it is standard planetary orbital theory which obviously none of you know anything about. In fact I did mention Goldstein's Classical Mechanics.

The picture that I am getting here is that the article has been hi-jacked by a group who have had a basic introduction to circular motion but who would be incapable of handling elliptical or hyperbolic motion and so they will all make sure that no such generalizations appear in the main article.

Your group has indulged in a number of deceitful tactics which I will now list.

(1) Making arguments in polar coordinates but jumping into Cartesian coordinates to conceal the flaws. The main example is circular motion, which is all that you seem to be capable of considering. You accept one moment that there is a radially outward centrifugal force balancing a radially inward centripetal force. But as soon as the centrifugal force becomes inconvenient for you, you claim that it vanishes in the inertial frame, even though the centripetal force remains. That is just a nonsense.

(2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet. This is because you feel more comfortable in a field that nobody can understand. It is good cover for talking nonsense.

(3) Introducing Lagrangian mechanics.

(4) Introducing Hamiltonian mechanics.

(5) Introducing matrix algebra.

(6) Quoting Feynam.

We have seen all these tactics used in a pathetic attempt to deny the fact that centrifugal force only occurs when a particle actually possesses an angular velocity relative to a point.

The section which I put in yesterday contained partically all hat you need to know about centrifugal force. But that was too good for you. You much prefer that big mindless waffle of an introduction that tells us absolutely nothing about centrifugal force.",0

Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",0

 Reason for moving title. 

It is mentioned clearly within this article and the scope of the Cholan wiki articles, that the whole of the island except for Ruhuna came under Raja Raja Chola's reign who established a dominion in Polannaruwa called the 'Mummudi Chola Mandalam'(which was an extension of the Chola empire) after he defeated the Kingdom of Anuradhapura.

Rajendra Chola annexed the remaining Ruhuna to the Chola rule in 1017, King Mahinda V was enslaved.

Then during a civil war in the Chola country in South India, Vijayabahu I would ally with the Pandyas and Cheras would rout the Cholan rule and establish a new kingdom in Polannaruwa.

This is backed up by renowned historians within the articles such as K.A. Nilakanta Sastri and George W Spencer in the article itself. The title 'Occupation' is baseless since the territories was incorporated to be a part of the kingdom and administration, and 'Anuradhapura' equally so, since the whole island came under Rajendra Chola's rule(with most of it already being under Raja Raja's).

 Creation and Destruction 

I wanted to respond earlier, but I wasn’t sure if I should ever address you again, because you seemed very offended.  But I find you an interesting subject.  You’re a computer programmer like me, (but more advanced), you have a semblance of devotion, as far as I can tell, and you like KJV like me.  If I have offended you, then I hope you will accept my apology.

The bible does say a lot of things about the motivations of people, and I really didn’t intend to direct any verses at you personally.  I really want to have a prophet's eye view of the human race.

When I saw the discussion I noted that evidence was being given by both sides, and I felt a desire to step outside of that perspective for a bit and give my own testimony of how the Lord has led in my life concerning these issues.  Since the time I wrote that I have had a fascination to study Creation Science, and I have had some overwhelming discoveries; treasures which I would like to share.

Matthew 13:52  Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.

Before I began to gather research, I suspected that there was already tons of evidence that would easily bury the Evolution Theory because it is a man-made theory designed by atheists to conveniently do away with moral responsibility to an intelligent Creator.  I realized that Adolf Hitler was huge fan of Evolution and thereby thought he was doing a good thing for mankind by eliminating the Jews, (but he only killed ~6 million).  Next on his list was the blacks.  His intention was to take over the whole world and progressively eliminate “inferior” races.  Of course there have been many other attempted genocides in the cause of progressing humanity by eliminating “weaker” races.  Some people may still sympathize with this cause.  We would call these racists and Neo-Nazis.  

“At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace, the savage races throughout the world.”  Charles Darwin, The descent of Man, chapter 3 and World Book Encyclopedia 1852, p. 336
“thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of higher animals, directly follows.”  Charles Darwin The Origin of Species… p. 243
“The standard of intelligence of the average adult Negro is similar to that of the eleven-year old youth of the species Homo sapiens.”  Henry Fairfield Osborn – Outspoken evolutionist and Curator of The American Museum of Natural History, New York
“No rational man, cognizant of the facts, believes that the average Negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man.”  Thomas Huxley (known as Darwin’s bulldog) 1871
Here’s a “theistic” evolutionist: “The Black People of Australia, exactly the same race as the African Negro, cannot take in the gospel… All attempts to bring them to a knowledge of the true God have as yet failed utterly... Poor brutes in human shape… they must perish off the face of the earth like brute beasts”  Kingsley C. Sermons on Natural Subjects Sermon XLI pp. 414-17, 1886, Charles Kingsley, an Anglican Priest who promoted Darwin.

A lot of people seem to feel more free if they convince themselves there is no Creator, but that people have evolved and just make their own gods and religions.
 """"With this single argument the mystery of the universe is explained, the Deity annulled, and a new era of infinite knowledge ushered in.”  Ernst Haeckel (“The Riddle of the Universe,” 1899, p. 337.) (This guy must have been high on PCP or something.  The theory he was explaining assumed that living cells are very simple.  This was before molecular biology.)
 “I suppose the reason we leaped at The Origin of Species was because the idea of God interfered with our sexual mores.” Thomas Huxley
 “I had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning; consequently assumed it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption.  For myself, as no doubt for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation. The liberation we desired”  Aldous Huxley

But I’ve already explained why fallen man would want such a thing, and at the start I suspected, though I had not done so much research yet, there was already overwhelming evidence to verify the biblical account of creation and the flood.  Discussing the evidence may persuade some, but never all.  Jesus made it plain that no amount of evidence will persuade those that are not willing to be persuaded.

"The opening paragraph/ introduction could be re-worded to sound a little nicer. I feel as though the introduction sets the stage for the entire article, so it is worth putting in the extra effort to make it flow. However the hyperlinks inserted into the first paragraph are good.

The outline of the bibliography is really good. However in the first paragraph, the sentence “Afterwards, he became a faculty member at the University of California, San Diego for 20 years.” sounds awkward, and could be re-worded.

The spacing between your referencing end notes and the start of a new sentence is not consistent. Make sure there is a space between the endnote and the start of the next sentence.

It might be beneficial to add a figure into your article in regards to the “Interactive Activation Model”. Could also potentially add one to illustrate backpropagation.

The first sentence in the “back-propagation learning algorithm” paragraph could flow a little better. 

Could also potentially add a chart in at the end of your article so summarize Rumelhart’s research theories. I feel as though this would really benefit your article because you mention so many theories.

Overall good article with a lot of good information. Also written in a way that would be easy for the general public to understand!

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposed revision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! 

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. 

This space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is but one example of a different logical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic, mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some other theoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then, with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).

Cosmologists are always wrong, but never in doubt. - Lev Landau (ref)""",0

We must follow what sources say; if you want to put in a rounded number and make up some error bars, but the source gives an exact number that's a Bad Thing.

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...).

  Look, I understand that Wikipedia doesn't try to add to knowledge, and only reports on what already exists. I brought up all of my little scenarios about being a preacher or author or internet essayist to prove a common point- it's not like an idea has to be written down to exist.
  I just wrote a lengthy counter argument but then realized that I was essentially restating what I had said before, and so the whole thing would be of no aid.
  Let me just say this- you think that my interpretations aren't commonsense, but I do- both make absolute perfect sense, but you're just sitting there right now like, """"uh, no."""" I mean, angel means messenger, so how is it impossible that some Biblical passages concerning angels aren't actually speaking about human messengers? Tell me. Prove me wrong. If angel means messenger then how can it perhaps not sometimes be referring to human messengers? Say something better than """"the onus is on you"""", because the argument is airtight- I already proved it. If I didn't then simply say what is illogical in my reasoning. I think that my contributions were blocked mostly because you don't agree with me.
  And I think Wikipedia's sourcing policy is illogical. I know that if I were to write a book with my opinions in it and then quote it on Wikipedia saying, """"page 10 of John Smith's book says..."""" it would not be blocked, because it is 100% true that my book would have those contents.

"TVTimes images
Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞ 

Your quibbles of fair use are so much ridiculous pedantry, and if this is the level of petty officiousness you subscribe to here, I'd sooner not bother. Fuck you, cunt.",1

"Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]

Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 

From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 

In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]

In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",0

 Going commando 

Why are you removing my edit from the Going commando post ? 

I do think of it as useful, since it is one of the most well-known examples of someone who was going commando. Grtz. 

I understand you wish to discourage edits that are purely between British and American spelling, but in British usage """"practise"""" is a verb and """"practice"""" is a noun.  I think this may be a useful distinction.   

 My RfA 

Thank you for your support in my recent RfA. I think valid criticisms were raised in areas that I need to work on, so I've withdrawn my name. I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior. Perhaps I may re-explore adminship at some point in the future, but it's a little early to consider that. Again, thank you.

 Strength training 

Hi,

You removed a bunch of text from the strength training article (the 'common concerns' section).  I reverted your edit, and this is to let you know why.  You said in your edit summary """"deleting copyvio from http://www.tranquillizer.co.uk/weight-training-concerns.html"""" - if you look at that page, you can see at the end of some statements, there are numbers thus """"[17]"""".  The tranquillizer site actually copied the information from wikipedia, not the other way around.  Its not a copyvio from us, it's a copy vio from them.  Just a head's up.

 

Sounds like you think the section's biggest problem is the tone of the section rather than the section itself.  I'd agree with that, I'll try for a re-write if I have time in the near future.

I merely meant, in my pre-amble to what I was saying, that I believed that """"assumptions contrary to that indicated in the reference"""" should not be made, where there was not clear indication that the person had adopted the nationality of the place of their death.

 Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind 

Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. 

My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: """"Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."""" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section.   """,0

Empty Sections
 Should the empty sections in this biography just be removed?   
Not really. If you notice, all of them are linked to articles that focus on every aspect of Pedro II's life: from his birth until his death and even after (Legacy). Right now I am working on them. One (early years) has been raised to GA. Another one (decline and fall) is being reviewed and might become GA. Once all are written and are considered GA I will work on Pedro II's article itself based on those focused articles. Of course if someone else wants to do that on my place, he or she can fell free to to it. Regards,   

National Assembly
The article contains at present 8 references to """"National Assembly"""". No political body existed by that name in the Empire of Brazil. The Brazilian imperial parliament was called """"Assembléia Geral"""" (General Assembly). The General Assembly was a bicameral legislature, comprising the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (see Political Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, arts. 13 and 14). Accordingly, I propose that references to """"National Assembly"""" should be changed to references the General Assembly. Wikipedia should not invent names for the political institutions of a country189.122.211.125  .

When creating a section in an article's talk page, you should do it at the bottom.
The name """"Assembléia Geral"""" can also be easily translated to National Assembly. There are authors who use """"Regulating Power"""" but also """"Moderating Power"""" in reference to """"Poder Moderador"""" and sometimes is not the best to make a direct translation. The other articles about Brazilian imperial history also use the translation """"National Assembly"""".   

I have found both """"National Assembly"""" and """"General Assembly"""" used in references. """"National Assembly"""" seems to have a long history in 19th century English-language press and other accounts. I assume that """"National Assembly"""" was used to distinguish this assembly from other types of assemblies (i.e., not the national legislature) for the benefit of their English-language audience. I have introduced the Portuguese title for the assembly at the points where it would first be seen by readers. Readers can decide the translation for themselves.   talk 

Speech from the Throne paining
In the painting by Pedro Américo (called Speech from the Throne), the Emperor is portrayed not actually delivering the Speech, but standing, before seating on the Throne to deliver the speech. So I propose that the caption of the painting should not say that the emperor is portrayed """"delivering"""" the Speech, but """"about to deliver"""" it. However, given that prior edits on this point have generated confusion, I will post this proposal here and wait until tomorrow. If there is no objection then I'll make the change. It seems to me that the editor Lecen had finally agreed that the use of """"delivering"""" in the caption did not reflect the reality of the painting, but now another editor (Astynax) has again resorted to the use of that language when making an edit intended to reduce the size of the caption. I agree with Astynax that the mention """"in the opening of the General Assembly"""", can be suppressed, but I submit that to return to the word """"delivering"""" is misleading. 189.122.211.125  

One more time: when you create a section, you must do it at the BOTTOM of the talk page. There is no reason to be so precise about the caption of the image. It is not necessary to have him holding a piece of paper in the picture to have the right to write """"delivering"""". What matter is that he was dressed in regalia due to the Speech of the Throne. That's it. If there is a painting of a boy with a book opened but he is not reading it yet does not mean that we can not write its capiton as """"Boy studying"""". If you do want to help Wikipedia, start writing other articles related to Brazilian imperial history. There are plenty that have few to no info. Also, the wording used on this article and several others related to it - tha are rated Good Articles - on Assembléia Geral is National Assembly. It can not be written """"General Assembly"""" on a caption wh",0

HurricaneWarning Template

Greeting, My Friend,

Both """"camps"""" in this discussion have compelling arguments, and I'm not sure on which side of the dispute I'd settle if I decided to comment.  You are correct that the template in question is contra ASF, and is not something anyone would wish to see universalized by extrapolation: every WP article could merit some sort of advisory template, if one accounted for every possible precaution.  I concur also with MiraLuka, and find the wording of the template slightly paternalistic.

You have requested consultation, I think, because the arguments advanced by your respected opposites appeared insufficient and/or policy-contravening.  I do believe their arguments have great strength, despite some flaws.  Examine, for a moment, your comment:

""""If the primary purpose of the template is to aid/advise readers in a humanitarian fashion (as I think it is), then the template exists to serve goals that are, IMHO, wholly unencyclopedic and irrelevant to the project (the death of a few readersor even valuable contributorsand the concomitant bad press is likely to have only a de minimis deleterious effect on the project)""""

From the record, I see that you registered with Wikipedia in late-December 2005; as such, you may not be familiar with the facts (and the turmoil) surrounding John Seigenthaler, Sr.  In that instance, a single false assertion (albeit a very significant one) garnered for Wikipedia enormous negative press attention, and caused many observers to question the viability and basic premises of the project  a great boon for the Britannica boosters.  The lessons of that episode are numerous, but those applicable here include: 1) The smallest misplaced line of text is a potential danger; 2) Liability for a project in the public eye exists not simply in the law, but even moreso in the press.

It is a sad commentary on the state of the American public that I can easily imagine many readers relying solely on Wikipedia without thinking for themselves.  In most contexts, caveat lector; let them be undone by their ignorance.  In highly visible situations, however, where the press is likely to overextend itself in finding and pillorying any """"villian,"""" no matter how remote the causation, or how unjustified the charge, Wikipedia must take care.  This is an encyclopedia first, but also a non-profit foundation existing on donations.  As editors, we have a duty to protect the reputation of the project.

This raises a second point.  There is a rhetorical error in your comment cited above that has little to do with logic, except perhaps the logic of human psychology.  Large groups are rarely coldly analytical, a fact I find unfortunate quite often.  Nevertheless, it is a fact to which a wise persuader should adapt. """"The death of a few readers...is...a de minimis deleterious effect...""""  This sentence is likely to win one more opposition than support, even if it be logical and empirically correct.  Those who think first from emotion might well react to such sentiment with alarm.

On the precedent of Seigenthaler, I understand why your opposition is showing extraordinary caution when confronting the spectre of a possible high-visibility """"press event,"""" ie. natural disaster.  Given your rhetorical misstep, I understand also why you might fail in this argument, even if the opposition were meritless (thankfully, they are not so.)  On balance, you are probably more correct; the case is not unambiguous, though.  Policies and guidelines exist as principles to be applied by the responsible community in its decision-making fora.  Very rarely, an underdeveloped discussion will ignore these principles, in which case, review (and chastisement) are warranted.  More typically, well-meaning editors apply principles as best they can to cases where principles conflict or overlap.  This case is an example of the latter, and you should waste no worry over the result. Best wishes,  """,0

Regarding my decision: the concepts you were trying to present exist in the book's article; greater expounding does not, in my good faith search, exist in any documented form that conforms to our expectations, such as found at WP:V and WP:RS.

That book, poorly referenced itself as being notable enough for inclusion, is barely enough to address such an obscure presentation.  100,000% greater clarity is required to make any sense of the topic as it is. -  talk

There doesn't seem too much about druids here.  Yes, the article explains the different shpeshifts fairly indepth, but I think that needs some explaining.

It seems like whoever wrote the section on druids just did it to get it out of the way so they can talk about how shadow preists are the best at pvp =).  

I'd do it myself but: a.) I don't have any experience writing stuff for wiki, and b.) maybe a more experienced WoW player could write it up better than I could.  If nothing else, I think the shapeshift section could be shortened slightly to make way for more room on lore and Druids in general.

"""

 When asked """"Are you an agnostic or an atheist?"""", Russell replied:
Agnostic, of course. Atheists are like Christians: That is, both dogmatically mantain that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that God does exist; the atheist holds that God does not. But the agnostic knows that we simply do not possess sufficient grounds either to affirm or deny the existennce of a supreme being. So I believe that although the existence of God is not impossible, it is improbable. Quite improbable.

A more clarifying answer, as mentioned above, can be found in Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic? (1947), where Russell states:


As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

I fully understand what you mean in your first point; AGF gets pushed to its limit at times.
I am not sure how to get a better response - I have had similar experience with RfCs. I am hoping that, since this would have oversight, it would be seen as more """"serious"""" than an ordinary RfC, which would bring some additional comment. But thought will need to go into this to see how best to advertise it.
The """"lack of interest"""" idea was literally just an idea. The thrust of this 'proposal' is that, by causing the """"loudmouths"""" (such as me!) to shut up after presenting their case, it would be easier for other parties to discuss the salient points of the issue. In my experience, important points get """"lost"""" in the debate as one side or the other will (sometimes deliberately) drown them out with side-issues. This is why the role of overseer is crucial. The overseer would be required to look out for people doing this and rein them in. In that environment a consensus has a better chance. However, we must have a mechanism by which resolution can be achieved without consensus (in a similar way to ArbCom). Hence, the idea would require an """"oversight committee"""" (to be dubbed """"OverCom"""", no doubt) that would make a """"final resort"""" decision. I suspect that this would usually be in favour of one side or the other, but they should perhaps have the option of saying """"neither is right"""" (or both, to some extent).

 Assyrian propaganda on Wikipedia 
Is this the way how you handle problems on Wikipedia by simply closing the case without finding a compromise? What happens, if I put Aramean continuity related topics to the """"Assyrian people"""" article and everything will be deleted or distorted by Assyrian fascists again, because they think they are the owner of this article? They even have a WikiProject called Assyria and don't care about neutrality and support Assyrianism. We are fed up that all our contributions on Wikpedia even with references are getting removed  without a valid reason. Are you there to check it and undo it? This is why I was in favour for a neutral common page called Assyrian/Syriac people, Syriac people or whatever focused only on our Christian heritage, where we all agree on. What's wrong with the idea to create articles within a common page to express each groups views? The current Assyrian people article mixed up with Assyrian plus Aramean topics would led to edit wars again.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.

"Atabek again when you call Kasravi a pan-Iranian nationalists and not acceptable, then I can call Tapper an anthropologist which he is.  If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. 
 تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.
 Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.

I want to point out a few possible problems with some specific sections or topics, esp pertaining to 'no citations':

no citation, npov: The system is still encountering strain and financial constraints, some say more than ever. And what is the point of the sentence anyways?
Healthcare
The Campbell government inherited a health care system that was encountering strain and financial constraints upon assuming office.

No citation: It also has an issue that he campaigned on NO cuts to government workers, hospital workers, etc, in fact, when accused by the NDP of his going to have to make large cuts and layoffs, he fired back that the NDP was fear mongering:
[edit] Income tax reductions
In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to significantly reduce income taxes. A day after taking office, Campbell reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent over two years. Cuts were applied to every tax bracket; the tax rate on the first $30,000 of income was cut by 2 points from 8.4% to 6.05%, while the top tax rate for income over $85,000 was cut by 5 points from 19.7% to 14.7%.

No citation:
Education
While funding was increased to record levels during the Campbell government’s first term in office, challenges remained in K-12 education.

Again, no citation. Campbell might have been in favour, but it was started by the NDP, as many pundints are quick to point out when hospital closures are compared against the cost of new luge track.
2010 Olympics
British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2nd, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. [18].
Campbell, a main proponent of the bid to get the games, attended the final presentations in Prague, Czech Republic and made an impassioned plea for the games to come back to Canada for the first time since it was held in Calgary in 1988.

This is only a quick look. I would appreciate some feedback before changes are made.
As I have pointed out earlier, a great deal of this article reads like a press release. If you compare this premier with any other, there will be a world of difference. 

Perhaps it should be scaled back to the bare minimum bio, and everything else gets chucked into the appropriate spot.

This is a bit different than the Venere case, where she was born ethnically Italian, even though northern Italy was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

What needs to be done

Looking at this page after a break, I see a couple of things:

There needs to be a Slavery and religion or Religion and slavery article.
The article focuses on scripture, but the article is about religion. If the title is religion, the sections should be Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Otherwise, the article should be renamed """"Slavery in Abrahamic scripture(s)"""".
The section on the New Testament needs so much work I don't want to pull it out as there'll be nothing left. I think it should have a NPOV tag.

 Intersection of Profession, Religion and Gender on Wikipedia 

Hi BHG, I'm posting this to you because I noticed you participated in an old series of CfD discussions and are familiar with it.

In the process of reviewing the situation involving the various articles on Islamic scholarship Islamic mathematics, Islamic science, Islamic metaphysics etc.  which have been subject to extensive edit-warring and outright deletion or stubbing in the case of some articles by two groups of editors broadly labeled Islamophiles and anti-Revisionists  a third group of people who might be termed Irrelevantists as they were unfamiliar with the subject and considered it non-notable due to religious content (which the anti-revisionist history buffs do not; they merely are vehemently against anything in the article that smacked of promotion) referred folks to the old discussions that led to the deletion of the """"Professionals by religion"""" Category, e.g. CfD:Astronomers by religion and CfD:Mathematicians by religion.

The vast consensus of those two discussions were that religion was utterly irrelevant to the personal or professional life of those professionals and even asked """"when would it end?"""" Much cracks were had about how religion was once relevant to scientists' lives but is now a historical curiosity. However the discussion boiled down to it being a non-intersecting and """"frankly absurd"""" means of categorizing people.

What I find interesting is that the same policies could be provided for Category:Women by occupation and yet no one has ever proposed deletion of that entire (huge) category tree, and in fact insisted on the exact opposite arguments, despite the fact that some women actively do object to being labeled as a """"Woman scientist"""", whereas no astronomer has ever objected to being labeled religious despite the disingenuous claim made in the above CfD. 

(Caveat: The only deletion ever proposed for the gender categories that I can see is that """"Women"""" is non-grammatical, which I disagree with  it sounds better than """"Female"""" and is commonly used even in cases where it is a neologism, such as """"women earth scientists"""" - grammatical but ridiculous)  the latter is a prime case of what I'm talking about. If it had been """"Muslim earth scientists"""" or another religion, it would have been deleted """"with extreme prejudice"""" and some vitriol by """"science vs. religion"""" types. But the rationale used would have been that it was non-intersecting and an article couldn't be written about it, which seems to be being selectively applied by Brightists on this site. (Some of these categories, an article could be written but that doesn't mean a category should exist, as one person on the """"Female"""" CfD noted. Especially since the women-in-science movement is very divided about whether women professionals should be categorized as such.) 

Full disclosure: a close family member is both a woman scientist and the past president of a graduate women in science professional organization, so no bias here.   """,0

 Deleting from that article, from One hitter (smoking and others, numerous pictures of small-bowl or """"one-hitter""""-type pipes which, for inhalant herbal use, constitute the principal alternative or competition to cigarettes, alias """"joints"""".

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

[27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none. 

And there is such a biased section on Turkey. the editor andranik, an armenian by origin, who carries the name of the armenian terrorist and nationlist milita head accuses",0

 Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet's character 

The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father's miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.

The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.

Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.

The Crying of Lot 49

1

ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.

The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (""""Mucho"""") Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. """"Pierce, please,"""" she'd managed to get in, """"I thought we had""""

""""But Margo,"""" earnestly, """"I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,"""" or something.

""""For God's sake,"""" she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.

""""Why don't you hang up on him,"""" Mucho suggested, sensibly.

""""I heard that,"""" Pierce said. """"I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow."""" Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.

""""Mucho, baby,"""" she cried, in an access of helplessness.

Mucho Maas, home, bounded through the screen door. """"Today was another defeat,"""" he began.

"MSU Interview 

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

 Explanation of my recent edits 

Removing bolding and external links within article per WP:MOS. Only first word of section titles should be capitalized, and NCNM should not be placed on section headings (each section is about the subject of the article).

Removal of peacock terms and redundant phrasing, """"extensive, unique, geared to, in its course offerings, more universal, opens numerous, in which students are immersed, designed for students with a special affinity, wanting a more streamlined graduate experience, fully"""". If actually extensive needs a RS that describes it that way, likewise with unique or a description of how its unique. Geared to unless we are talking about gears this is marketing. In its course offerings is redundant. More universal with an explanation this is unnecessary, however universality is a pretty large if vague claim. Students are immersed, describe how program is immersive provide a RS that says it is notable for that. Designed for students with a special affinity, designed for students is a given for a school and special affinity sounds like peacock for interest in. Wanting a more streamlined graduate experience is marketing peacock speak for shorter/smaller course of study. Fully (accredited) is assumed if only partially accredited that would be spelled out. 

Removed wikilink on word school to article Medical school NCNM is not a medical school as described in target article.

Adding ref improve tag: the entire Academic programs section has only the two refs supporting accreditation, the NCNM clinic section is completely unsourced as is the Accreditations and associations section and the NCNM history section. 

I placed 3 citation needed tags on some statements that definitely need references. These are very specific in addition to the article in general needing improved references.

Additional proposed edits:

I think expertise in """"with an expertise in natural medicine"""" should be removed if it can't be supported with a reference. Expertise is substantial claim for education and training only. I am not sure what """"a holistic Chinese medicine education in Western medical sciences"""" means. """"Since its founding, NCNM has sought to preserve and convey the classical modalities of naturopathy and honor the principles that guide naturopathic care:"""" could be rephrased, """"to preserve and convey the classical modalities and honor the guiding principles of naturopathy:"""" if that preserves the meaning. """"The college is alma mater to over 2,000 alumni"""" is redundant if your an alumni it's your alma mater.

"Health care is rationed in the United States.  This happens in public hospitals that provide care for the uninsured and those patients participating in socialized systems such as Medicare and Medicaid.  For example, there is a greater demand for dialysis, Xigirs, colonoscopies, and new technologies like HeartMate than what is being supplied to these patients.  Instead of spending more money to meet the demand, demand is artificially lowered through denial of treatment or waiting times.  This is rationing in the normal sense of the term.  Rationing is not normally used to refer to being unable to afford certain health care services in a free market system.",0

According to MOS:LEAD, the lead section should be proportional to the article. A three-paragraph lead would be way too long for an article of this length. However, you still should try to include some more information there, as it is a bit short. Include a short bit on her appearances and the critical reaction as noted above.
Concept and creation section looks good now, well done.
Expand or merge the Characterization section into other sections. With it that short, it seems as though you would easily graft it into appearances unless there's more info to be added.
You've met GA Criteria 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 easily.
""""She was once the most trusted advisor for the indecisive politician."""" is unclear. Who are you referring to? (Characterization section)
The article seems a bit short (this is my issue with Criteria 3, broadness). You seem to have covered most of the important bases, but there's not a whole lot of information in each. Some of the sections also cover information that would be better places elsewhere (as previously noted, in addition to mentioning Smart's Emmys in """"Concept and creation"""", it seems that would be better elsewhere or at least belongs in a subsection). Try working on how the article is laid out, and as Judgesurreal suggested, definitely use other articles as templates.
All in all, it looks pretty good, and would probably either pass or be an easily fixed-up """"on hold"""" if nominated for GA now. Well done, just consider taking a look at those to guarantee things. Best of luck!  (//c)

 Orlady has followed my edits and repeatedly made probably dozens of accusations, that I am asserting personality defects in others.  That is false, I believe.  The accusation seems like many others Orlady has made, which are arguably personal attacks.  I don't know what she is referring to, about the personality defects.  It adds up to her ascribing a personality defect to me, that I am a person who ascribes defective personalities.  Should Orlady be blocked?

What has been under discussion at wt:CONN has been churning of articles, both of vandalism and of reversions by experienced editors (addressing vandalism and also enforcing unfair/unexplained standards for keeping some unsourced info but disallowing new editors' contributions of same).  I have at times referred to long patterns of edits, after disagreeing with many specific edits.  I do eventually perceive really obvious patterns, like that Orlady is following my edits and finding fault.  That is true;  Orlady does not deny it.  It is nonsensical to prohibit my mentioning that.  It is a statement about the edits, plural.  In the edit that SarekOfVulcan mentions, I term one specific edit """"silly"""" (in challenging whether an NRHP-listed district is NRHP-listed) but I do not call Orlady that term.  Whatever Orlady is asserting I have done, she has done more of towards me.

I don't actually understand the standard SarekOfVulcan is applying with this block.  I don't understand a distinction that can be made about my edits, which would not apply more strongly for Orlady for example.  I have discussed Orlady's edits and she has discussed mine.  SarekOfVulcan seems to be applying some standard about """"discuss edits not editors"""", which is overall probably good guidance for wikipedia.  But, when I become aware of an editor repeatedly, i.e. hundreds of times, engaging in a behavior, and i describe that behavior as a pattern of edits, I do not think that is prohibited.  It is not helpful to prohibit that.

Note, Orlady has refused mediation previously and has chosen not to answer repeated questions whether she would engage in mediation now.  Above she complains that I did not reply about a private email.  It is a worse offense not to reply to on-line request to engage in mediation.  I requested her to answer whether she would, three times, within this recent discussion and she has not answered. ncram """,0

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list.

I think you sound like a delusional, academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own.  I've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood.  My point is that while they have always been present, perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere, they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood. They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like """"Dike Slope"""".  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim.  But, that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years.

 Goan Inquisition's version of Ahatallah: Defamatory article. 

The version of Ahatallah given in the article is extremely biased and insulting to even the Roman Catholic St. Thomas Christians, not to mention the non-catholic ones.This is the faulty premise/statement on which the entire article of lies and propaganda is based upon: """"However, later research by Joseph Thekedathu, relying on additional documents found in the archives in the Vatican and Goa, has established further details of his life""""

First of all the """"researcher"""" Joseph Thekedathu is known for his extreme anti-St. Thomas Christian views. He can hardly be considered a historian or researcher in the proper sense. He is a fanatic roman catholic, and all his articles(some additional websites which he maintains online) are full of hate material against the Protestants, Orthodox and Nestorian christians of India. Most of this article is based upon his """"research"""".

Also how can anyone rely on """"Vatican and Goa"""" archives to make up the history of Ahatallah? Goa is notorious as the place of the horrible catholic inquisitions in India where hundreds of saint Thomas christians, nestorian prelates, jews, muslims and hindus were burned alive at the stake. It was a former portuguese colony. There are no Saint Thomas Christians in Goa, all are Roman Catholics of the Latin rite, and Goa got independence and merged with India only in 1956, 9 years after Independence of India. Until then it was a portuguese colony.

Vatican archives or journals made in 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, midst the horrible Inquisitions cannot be considered proper hisotrical manuals to present the history of their traditional enemies- the Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala. This article is highly insulting to every Saint Thomas Christians for this reason- it is history made by its enemies and by people with an agenda to convert them.

122.172.118.114  
The second book quoted by cuchullian, ie Frykenbergs book clearly mentions that Ahatallah was a Syriac Orthodox. However Cuchullian copy pasted only the parts in stephen neills books and those quotes of Joseph Thekkedathu and presented a manipulated, concocted jesuit tale of the man Ahatallah, who is being ridiculed and mocked here as a roman catholic and agent of the Pope. His killers are presented as his masters. There is no greater way in which anyone can trample upon an indigenous community and spit upon the face of their Saint.""",0

Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses
29-Apr-2010: It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment, to include numerous other sources. Originally, that section was quickly created to begin the topic. At first, the issue was treated as a """"he said she said"""" dispute (when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims). However, now, there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section, including:
 In June 2009, Knox testified they repeatedly asked, """"Did you hear Meredith scream?"""" and she replied no, no, and no. When they insisted how was that possible, she claims that she said, """"I don't know; perhaps I had my fingers in my ears."""" That became: """"Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming"""" (invented false confession).
 Knox's father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda, for years.
 Knox's father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect.
 One of the police officers (from that night) testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming (not hearsay).
 Patrik L. (Knox's boss at the pub Le Chic) stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day.
 Author Douglas Preston, in several reports, has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor, and commented about that in relation to Knox's testimony.
All such statements are allowed, per Wikipedia policies, because they are not WP:SYN synthesis, but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment. The current text of the section must be expanded per WP:NOTCENSORED and WP:NOTPAPER. Expect the article to exceed 200kb, when similar basic details have been added. -  """,0

Ever thought of joining Wikipedia:WikiProject Mixed martial arts?  I noticed you have lots of MMA related edits.  We are now taking suggestions for the new MMA article improvement drive,  please add your input to decide what the first collaboration should be.  

I probably should get around to joining at some point. I don't think I have the time right now to contribute much to the article improvement drive, but I keep my eye on several MMA-related articles for vandalism, nonsense, etc. I'll probably throw my name in the members section.  

I'll second that, your contributions show you've made a lot of positive edits to MMA-related articles. Keep up the good work! 718

 Arbitrary revision reverting 

If you are going to reverse a revision that has been researched and well crafted, be consistent across the board.  Compare content with other similar entries which are considered acceptable, then rethink your actions.  Read the Muhammed Ali, Fedor Emelianenko, Chuck Liddell biographies for examples of what is considered relevant information, particularly regarding fight descriptions.  Make changes to all of those wiki entries if you feel that your standards should be universally accepted. 
Please see WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. I'm sure Tuckdogg will get around to cleaning up those articles too. .718 at 20:17, September 25, 2007

Again, there remain very few facts that we can associate with GG overall short of what's in the current History section - it is a war of opinions here, that's why its a controversy.  Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS. So because ethics claims have been discussed, if not then debunked by the authors in the next breath, in these highly reliable sources, we can discuss them in a non-prejudging way and then later include the criticism of them; that's how we meet all content policies. End of the day we cannot appear to take a side in the GG issue, and everything you have said above is against that point. And that I'm """"trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories"""" to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them. That's exactly what we must do here.  (t)

The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the non-Socialist press. This welcome was mainly silence, broken by the review in TLS headed 'Morris & Marxism''

Note the interest in Wikipedia:Featured pictures shared by all three accounts. Nick then posts to Masem's talkpage, linking this vandalized version of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wagner and identifying Pirated as a sock of Wagner. In that vandalized revision, note that the vandalism included references to Montenegro. Pirated, after being reverted for attempting to use the al-Qaeda flag, requested to use the Podgorica flag. Podgorica is the capital of Montenegro. At this point, H.W.C. complained that I am """"blocking users with little evidence and expecting people to clean up the rest after him again"""" (emphasis mine).

Additionally, note that H.W.C. created his account and immediately started making featured picture nominations centering around video games. Wagner has occasionally talked about being a video gamer to his own socks. Additionally, H.W.C. signed up for the WikiCup with a Montenegro flag, which he later changed to the Podgorica flag. He clones 's userbox and adds another of Mason's userboxes to his userpage. Mason Doering is a known sock of Wagner.

"Article has been merged and redirected

Content of this article was more in line with Photoshop contest than any encyclopedic article on Photoshopping in it's full or even slang use, so the text from this article was merged there. It may not read smoothly there, and may have more photos than necessary, but I put a cleanup tag there and certainly the minority of people who wanted this page to be able such contests can go there and clean it up to their liking.

I redirected this term to photo manipulation article, as it was more in line with what the term meant (though technically Adobe Photoshop would have made more sense, but we have to go with consensus I guess). It appears someone else just moved photo manipulation elsewhere, so that may have to get cleaned up later. 

But, bottomline here is that the Photoshopping article no longer exists, as it was clear from discussion that it never should have in the first place but that a few editors with misplaced motives ignored for a long time and edit warred across several articles over. Kind of sucks that even an admin or two was involved, but then I guess even admins can make mistakes and work in bad faith.",0

 'Assessment' vs. 'diagnosis' 

This section was moved here from /Comments subpage by TalkCs  

I am new to this, and finding my way, so sorry if I get things wrong. I am a British Art Therapist(and a Council Member, British Association of Art Therapists). The art therapy article as it stands is very US based, and there are significant differences. I propose to start contributing to the page with this in mind. My first proposed addition is this, in the section on assessment tools:

'It is important to note however that attitudes to assessment differ internationally. 'Assessment' is easily confused with 'diagnosis'. Because diagnosis is a medical function rather than a therapeutic one, British art therapists tend to resist the implied medicalisation of what is essentially a non medical approach, which concentrates on 'seeing the person, not the label'. The British Association of Art Therapists statement on diagnosis simply states that ‘Art Therapists do not diagnose…' (http://www.baat.org.uk)'

Any thoughts on this before I go ahead?""",0

These laws are called The Hammurabi Code. 

 The Hammurabi Code 
The Hammurabi code are laws written in stone. Scientists had found a stone of laws written by a priest that was told to write the laws that King Hammurabi said. one of the laws are """"If you kill a father's son in the fire, then your son will be killed in the fire too."""" or """"If you steal something during a fire, then you will chop off your hands.""""

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """,0

Hi. While it's great that you want to contribute to Wikipedia, there is a whole host of problems with your article which you might want to consider. First, you have eliminated the redirect to another page, but haven't put in a hatnote or anything that will indicate to the reader where that page is. But the main problem is that there are no reliable source references that either establish the subject's notability, or support any of the text that is written. The official website, blog, twitter etc - none of those count. There have to be independent third-party sources about the guy, otherwise the whole thing will get deleted.

I'ld like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff. Martin's remark """"the answer is 2/3"""" and mine, """"no, the answer is switch"""". I did not mean to imply that the 2/3 should be made completely invisible. Of course one must emphasize that a good *reason* to switch is because the probability is 2/3 that you'll get the car this way. It is even a very very good reason to switch, since it is can be shown (if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car) that you can't do better; in particular, complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success! (Morgan et al; Gill).

I hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it's possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with. And which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature.

Remember: Vos Savant and Whitaker ask what the player should do. Introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action. The phrase """"the probability"""" leads straight to controversy, at least to disagreement (both among editors and in the literature). The phrase """"what action should the player take"""" leads to concensus (both among editors and in the literature).

"Another ridiculous article by WikiPedia ==

Your section on how to define area is as vague as most of your other articles. Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

I guess I should be happen that the article went from a G to an A but clearly Orange Mike doesn't appreciate the nuances of desktop virtualization.

"This is ridiculous; such a condition does not exist according to any policies or guidelines. It isn't my fault that you can't see the obvious. I haven't seen you blocking Grandmaster when he accused Azizbekov of being a sock, claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. Azizbekov was consequently banned when Vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. Neither have I seen you block him when Antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock, again without any evidences provided. As a consequence, Andranik was ALSO banned. I have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like Christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. I also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.

Accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned, like those of Grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. Accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock, which is the case with Ehud. And I will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all, this condition is unacceptable. And I will not be contesting my block either. I know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. I don't expect anything anymore. Its plain fishy, Vartan gets the restriction, I get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with Atabek.

It should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sock-puppetry, especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. Furthermore, a block should be preceded by an official warning on the user's page, with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. A simple request on other pages doesn't satisfy this.

1 - I was not referring to this, only your posts on Wikipediocracy recently.
2 - I was not referring to these events dating back to 2009, it does not appear relevant to your actions now.
3 - I am sure people can refer to the Arbcom case for the facts if they wish. I did review the situation with a sitting Arbcom member before starting RFA, as you are aware.
4 - This is the first time I have heard about it. It seems a bit late to be digging this up now.
5 - I know nothing about this, your page was not even on my watch-list until today.
6 - No, I was not even aware of """"revenge nominations"""". If I ever commented in a DR related to this, it was not as part of any pattern and I do not recall ever doing so. I do not watch everything you do on Commons, nor did I watch everything Russavia did. I am not Russavia, nor do I take responsibility for his actions. If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.
7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons. The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.

Your 7 responses appear to avoid the central issue, which is how you are now using Wikipediocracy to hound me. You appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. If you have allegations to make, please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then I can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.

Again, you are digging through history, some of which is 7 years old and the most recent is now 3 years old. It would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud, most of which I have forgotten as I have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.

"Liver Disorders
The liver is the second largest organ in your body and is located under your rib cage on the right side. It weighs about three pounds and is shaped like a football that is flat on one side. The liver performs many jobs in your body. It processes what you eat and drink into energy and nutrients your body can use. The liver also removes harmful substances from your blood. How does a healthy diet help the liver? Eating a healthy diet helps the liver to do its functions well and to do them for a long time.  Eating an unhealthy diet can lead to liver disease. For example, a person who eats a lot of fatty foods is at higher risk of being overweight and having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. For people who have liver disease, eating a healthy diet makes it easier for the liver to do its jobs and can help repair some liver damage. An unhealthy diet can make the liver work very hard and can cause more damage to it. What does a healthy diet include? •Eating foods from all the food groups: grains, proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and fats •Eating foods that have a lot of fiber such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads, rice and cereals Are there diet changes for those with liver disease? It is important for people with liver disease to maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet with foods from all food groups. Also, •Do not eat uncooked shellfish such as oysters and clams •Limit eating foods that have a lot of sugar or salt Liver Diseases and Diet Some liver diseases have specific diet recommendations: Bile Duct Disease Bile is a liquid made in the liver that helps break down fats in the small intestine. Bile duct disease keeps bile from flowing to the small intestine. Diet Recommendations: • Use fat substitutes • Use kernel oil (i.e. canola, olive, corn, sunflower, peanut, flax seed oils) because it needs less bile to break down fats than other types of oil Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is the scarring and hardening of the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt •Talk to your doctor about how much protein to have in your diet Fatty Liver Disease Fatty liver disease is the build up of fat in liver cells. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that are high in calories •Eat foods that have fiber Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is the build up of iron in the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Do not eat foods that have iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Do not take pills with iron •Do not eat uncooked shellfish Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have a lot of iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt Wilson Disease Wilson disease is the build up of copper in the body.

Fusion-Mutiny

The Fusion and Mutiny played more games than are listed on this page.  Their rivalry lasted from 1998-2001.   

 Rowdies vs Miami Toros? 

Any thought to expanding this rivalry to include its pre-history, the 1975 and 1976 NASL Seasons when the Rowdies played against the Miami Toros, who would become the the Strikers? If we are including MLS matches, this notion would also seem logical to me. Cheers to all! -  

Original research
I know there's been a lot of earnest work here, but the premise appears to be entirely original research. It combines information and scores for every team from the two metropolitan areas, whether there was any real connection or not. The original Tampa Bay Rowdies were not related to the Tampa Bay Mutiny or the modern Tampa Bay Rowdies/FC Tampa Bay. The original Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami Toros were not related to the second Fort Lauderdale Strikers, the Miami Fusion, or the third Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami FC. And of course several of those were named for or played in Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. I doubt that any source outside of Wikipedia has ever pulled them all together like this. Most of the sources used here are either self-published blogs, or they just give information on individual teams or games; they don't make a claim about an overall rivalry lasting since the 1970s. Unfortunately, this article may need a total reshifting in focus to keep it. t/c 

Allow me to address your areas of concern about this page:

THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? 

BLOGS AS A SOURCE: A quick count of the sourcing shows 37 of the 91 cited sources are from blogs, etc. Even by the broadest of definitions (i.e. 50% + 1), this is not """"most of the sources"""" as you state. It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets. Closer examination will further show that even some of the blog sourced material happens to be previously published np photos and/or articles that were scanned and posted in the blogs.

MLS era: In the MLS years, the Mutiny had several former Rowdies working in their front office staff, one of whom, by the way now happen to work for the current Rowdies. Both they and the Fusion had former NASL-era Rowdies and Strikers as their head coaches at one time or another. The Miami Ultras were originally the Fusion's supporters. They now follow the Strikers. The connections were always there. As a matter of fact, inclusion of the Mutiny/Fusion era",0

 Edit war brewing at Yosemite National Park

Looked ... acted ... )   

I was also approached recently with regards to possible edits to the Yosemite National Park article. My input on the matter can be found at the following link;
user talk:Edit Centric#Hantavirus Risk in Yosemite

Noted,   

 Thmc1 / 173.63.176.93 sill sockpuppeting / REPLYU REQUSTED 

This person (blocked sockmaster Thmc1) is still block evading by not logging in, even after he was warned by SysAdmin Kudpung. I would suggest that you block the suspected IPs(173.63176.93, 74.88.160.244) as well as IPs used by his other blocked account (Nyc88) and any other accounts affiliated w/them. Why are sockppuppets of a blocked sockmaster still allowed to edit even after ample warnings? To make matters worse, he even violated his block and continuted editing the day after he was blocked! Please see Thmc1 sockpuppet investigation archive for latest investigation/evidence.   

No clue  links would be helpful.   

Actually I think it's the other way around, if I'm not mistaken, I think I remember   being mentioned to admin Ronhjones as a possible sockpuppet in the past few months in conjunction with an edit disagreement issue. Are you stocking this address? Is this some sort of retaliation? First of all, I have no idea who any of these other users are, much less others who use this IP address. 173.63.176.93  
Hmm... Thanks, I think, hadn't noticed the 173... above was the same as the 173... I just talked to .. still no clue why MBaxter showed up here. Aw well - keep on keepin' on   

Vsmith- Don't let 173.63.176.93 fool you. It was him who attempted to mention this to RonHJones using IP 74.88.160.244. That IP was found to be one of 173.63.176.93's sockpuppet and blocked after a recent investigation. 173.63.176.93 is actually a sockpuppet of Thmc1, blocked for excessive sockpuppeting back in 2010. Even though 173.63.176.93 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1's sockpuppet, he was let off with a warning. For the full story, I suggest that you check out Thmc1's most recent investigation, August 2012. The final assessment was one account (Nyc88) permanently blocked, one IP temporarily blocked, and one left open with warning. If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation. The reverting of your edits is the same kind of BS he conducted on the London City article that got him blocked back in 2010. He has an anti-UK bias amongst many, and you can confirm this with user Eraserhead1.   —Preceding undated comment added

VSmith, I actually came to your talk page for a different reason and just happened to notice this. It looks ridiculous and I think this MBaxter1 character is highly suspicious himself.

I think that this Yosemite hantavirus story is worthy of at least brief mention in the article because it is now having international implications. I just don't see a justification in ignoring it completely, thanks.173.63.176.93

You must understand that the concentration of power into the hands of a few administrators over an organization originally dedicated to open discourse and conversation is a bad thing. Please, tell me you understand that? 

The fact that users, much like yourself and very certainly like Zoe (she was the personification of such disgusting aggression and bullying) casually ban editors with whom they have disagreements, that they randomly delete articles (often with no debate whatsoever) because they find them distasteful, that they threaten editors who dare challenge their bellicose absurdity, is not a good thing.

Hello Deacon, thanks for the kind words. Your wording is better regarding territory, but I think that it still might specifically mention the Firth of Clyde, since Northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about """"between the Humber and the Firths of Clyde and Forth"""", or similar? But there's no great preference here either way.

Oswiu chose the Roman way at Whitby in 664, and he died in 670; thereafter there was a steady erosion of Iona-based clerics in Northumbrian territory, quite noticeable by Pehthelm's consecration in the 8th century ... have a look at the Skene reference I cite, which suggests that both Picts and Northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the Roman way in preference to the Columban way.

It looks like a political process, constant and steady, but not a sudden, forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of Northumbrian hegemony.

Ok, and after this here is now the detailled technical explanation and conclusive evidence for the UE categories and their achievable throughput: The calculation of the theoretical DL throughput in MBit/s according to the largest available carrier bandwidth of 20 MHz  is as follows: A 20 MHz carrier consists of 100 Ressource Blocks (RB). Each RB consists of 12 Subcarriers (SC), which can be divided into 2 time slots (TS) each that carry 7 ODFM-Symbols each. Further we have a QAM modulation scheme. The maximum QAM specified is 64QAM, which means there are 6 bits/symbol. Additionally we have 2x2 MIMO antenna technology which allows two parallel data layers (L). In total this results in: 100 RB * 12 SC * 2 TS * 7 ODFM-Symbols * 6 bit/Symbol * 2 L = 201,6 MBit/s (Absolute theoretical technical maximum DL data rate per 20 MHz carrier). [] (page 3).
Now let's take a look at the UE categories. This information derives from the specification document 3GPP TS 36.213 [] (page 25 to 34): Let's take a look at table 7.1.7.1-1:
Cat 4 Devices use coding scheme MCS28 for DL and MCS23 for UL. This leads to TBS Index 26 for DL and 21 for UL. Looking at table 7.1.7.2.1 we now look at N_PRB (# of Ressource Blocks) = 100 (corresponds to 20 MHz carrier). For the TCS indices above we find 75376 and 51024 respectively. This results in 51,024 MBit/s for the UL. For the downlink we have 2x2 MIMO, so there are 2 Layers. Corresponding to table 7.1.7.2.2: The available number of ressource blocks 75376 (SISO) translates to 149776 for 2x2 MIMO resulting in 149,776 MBit/s ~ 150 MBit/s. As can be seen this ist a bit less than the 2*75,376=150,752 MBit/s which are stated in the 3GPP UE table Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306.
Cat 3 Devices use coding scheme MCS23 for DL and UL. So with the explanation above we find: 51024 resulting in 51,024 MBit/s for UL again and with 2x2 MIMO for DL 101,8 MBit/s or simply 2*51,024=102,048 MBit/s (Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306).
If we now reduce the carrier block size to 10 MHz - what happens? The amount of ressource blocks reduces from 100 to 50 - that's all. The MCS coding scheme stays the same. The conclusion is that a Cat4 device is able to achieve a theoretical troughput of 73,712 MBit/s with 10 MHz (50 RB) (Tables 7.1.7.2.1 & 7.1.7.2.2) of spectrum. Subsequently a Cat3 device in contrast can only reach 50,024 MBit/s according to these two tables and not around 75 MBit/s as previously discussed. I hope this clarified the issue so far. I doubt, that the development group is wrong here in their own specification.   20:26",0

Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), """"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies"""". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that """"truth"""" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as """"significant coverage"""" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see """"NOTINHERITED"""" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.

To be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating """"50"""" notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put """"WP:BIGEVENT"""" they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  """,0

800-1169/1200?
New subheading:Upon a reminder from Fergananim on this question, as raised by him and enthusiastically supported by Scolaire, I said I'd elaborate a bit here. Looking though the discussion again I see I have already (tried to) say something about it.... Anyway, I think we should follow the now established historiographical division of of 800-1169. To amend problems the limitations from such a division I'm thinking the we should to the following
Add a couple of sentences, either in the lead or in the historiography section, explaining why this division is somewhat problematic. (Mind, any division that gets established is problematic, for the same reasons)
Have a solid background-section to draw the lines from before 800 into our period. I've slready started that, but it might be expanded.
Have a solid """"whatever-the-opposite-of-background-is-called-in-English""""-section drawing lines from our period into the future, so to speak.
Don't treat 1169 as limit written in stone, despite being in the title. The second synod of Cashel should be discussed here (despite being in 1172), the career of Rory O'Connor after the invasion should be included, etc etc.
It's not like I'm married to 1169 though, but maybe we could wait drawing a conclusion on this until I've gotten around to write something (except church history) about Ireland after 1050...

Ormewood is correct that later revisions by someone (to put all wind considerations into one section) caused a loss of continuity. I was the original author of the section """"Shape of The Tower"""" in March of 2007, so I know that the orphaned sentences answer the question: What mathmatical calculation was Eiffel referring to? I tried to edit the article, but found it is now semi-protected owing to excessive vandalism. I propose that an autoconfirmed user revise the entire paragraph as follows:
In search of what mathmatical calculation Eiffel referred to, researchers have found that Eiffel used empirical and graphical methods accounting for the effects of wind rather than a specific mathmatical formula. Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape; actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces. Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. As a demonstration of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.

My opinions as a fan are not in there in laudatory language. Stuff that was dramatic is now long gone or will be gone.  You are claiming that I say in the article that """"he began it all and towers over everybody else."""" WHERE? I don't. You are making things up. I mention the groups and the people he worked alongside as well but as this hugely famous person he stepped away from performing and became a full time activist!

Overstate what? He was as great and renowned athlete of the day as Pollard or Thorpe! Are you now negating reams of history and rewriting it too??? Where do you have this right? You don't.

Ok, here we go again:
""""That HUAC went after Communists (and little after those other groups) might have something to do with the fact that the Cold War involved a Communist empire, not a Nazi one.""""

The Cold War also involved brutal lynchings, Jim Crow, intimidation of blacks and union members of all races, civil liberties violations and segregationist leadership and members of congress, not to mention world wide human rights abuses, rape of resources, thefts, colonialist thievery, ethnic calseasing of people of color on four continents!

Some called for the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan to be interrogated by the HUAC. Martin Dies however was a supporter of the Klan and had spoken at several of its rallies. Other members of the HUAC such as John Rankin and John S. Wood were also Klan sympathizers. Wood defended the Klan by arguing that: """"The threats and intimidations of the Klan are an old American custom, like illegal whiskey-making.""""
Eventually Ernest Adamson, the HUAC's chief counsel, announced that: """"The committee has decided that it lacks sufficient data on which to base a probe."""" John Rankin added: After all, the KKK is an old American institution."""" Instead, the HUAC concentrated on investigating the possibility that the American Communist Party had infiltrated the Federal Writers Project and other New Deal projects.""""

I mean come on! If you truly believe that """"HUAC went after Communists (and little after those other groups) beacuse it might have something to do with the fact that the Cold War involved a Communist empire, not a Nazi one"""" you have not read ANY cold war civil rights history. They nver went after them WHEN we were at war. The US has NEVER gone after neo nazis/KKK/hate groups in even a remotely close fashion/dedication as they have to Leftits. Non-government groups and people have done the leg work for them.

I thank that's generalising too much. It wasn't just the right that isolated Robeson in the 1950s but a broad political spectrum.
WHITEWASH. Who and what was this broad spectrum?  Please? Isolated FROM is not the factor while ISOLATED BY IS! Apart from liberals who were scared away eventually who else was it then? And who instigated his blacklisting and persecution? the daily harassment and surveillances that were ceaseless, that led TO the isolation itself? You are reverting history no just this article.

I just don't want to have the basic fact that he supported (whatever the details) that political system to be swept under the carpet under romantic notions of """"socialist experiment"""".

 Content Dispute 

I'm going to try and mediate the Iranian peoples dispute here could you please post your arguments there and we'll try and come to an reasonable comprimise   

1)Hi, History section needs clarification, while linguistically all of those people are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother, I am pointing to the last paragraph of the history section. It should be clarified. Thanks. Talk + 
 Modern Persians themselves are a diverse group of peoples descended from various Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau including the Elamites. Although all Persians are linguistically connected to each other ethnic backgrounds are diverse with many different cultural traits. 
Would something like that be preferable to you  

Yes, but the word Iranians instead of Persians. Persians are by themselves a member of that linguistic group. Talk + 
 Ok, I stand corrected (I'm not familiar with the topic matter at hand here, I'm googling trying to find information) - if nobody objects I propse changing the paragraph to the above, it seems clearer to me   

No sorry this paragraph: Thus, not unlike the previous example of Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin, Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities.  Talk + 

Here I meant Iranian peoples linguistically are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother. so the claim refering to common ethnicity in the articler is not correct.
 Talk + 
 Ok, is Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin also an ethno-linguistic group? If so, should we add """"only"""" to Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities
  

The Iranian people Unlike gernmanic people are from quite different etnicities like Turkic, Persian and others uncertain. The whole sentence is wrong and POV. we should drop the word common ethnicity and clarify that it is only a linguistic term'''. Talk + 

2)The info box does not belong here. Iranian peoples are not an ethnic group. They are several different ethnicities speaking different languages. It should be removed as in any other linguistic group. Talk + 
 I think you have a valid point there, I would like to see the argument to the contrary before making a recomendation though.

3)Aryan is a linguistic term that refers to an ancient language group that was ancestral to the Indo-European family of languages''. [http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring01/Millig",0

Speedy deletion of Greg Howes
 A tag has been placed on Greg Howes requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Hi, n2e. It's great to have someone with an econ background looking at the Suburban Express article. You've proposed some sensible changes. But, as you can see, CorpM has a very strong point of view. The Suburban Express story is about a 19 year old kid who attacked incumbent Greyhound, decreased fares, increased frequency, and decreased travel times and then weathered attacks based on regulatory capture, predatory pricing, and (not covered in any press) harrassment by the Chicago Transit Authority, which leased space to Greyhound. It is novel in that S.E. sidestepped economic regulation which was designed to ensure legacy carriers (greyhound, et al) a fair return on their investment but which had morphed into a system that supported inefficiency, high fares, and lousy service. Since you teach, I imagine you can appreciate the issues we have with students trying to get what they want, regardless of the agreement they have with us. 

e have battled all sorts of fraud during the course of our history - people making fake tickets, tons of bad checks, people passing their receipt out the bathroom window to a friend who then tells driver he is getting back on, and so forth. Fraud has lead to collection action of various forms, and it recently got some negative press because a small handful of nasty little assholes decided to devote their lives to trashing us. Their actions have not impacted ridership, but they have frustrated my employees and I by trashing us online wherever they get the chance. My instincts tell me that the user who is most committed to injecting POV into the article was contacted by one of the haters, who works in PR for the university and has contacts in that world. 

The supposed """"controversy"""" is a mish-mash of different issues that the haters are promoting, all rolled into one: 1) we filed 100ish small claims suits in a short period of time. the number was unusual because we had about a 2 year backlog of debts to collect; 2) A subcontracted driver was rude to a student who does not speak english. He was promptly reprimanded and we sought to apologize to the passenger, but did not succeed in identifying her. A loudmouth narcissistic attention seeking student who was on the bus posted the story to facebook from the bus and spent every waking moment posting the story everywhere he could. 3) This led to a situation on Reddit where the loudmouth and his friends were trashing S.E. as best they could and the moderator started manipulating the conversation, by deleting comments made in support of S.E. That got out of hand and our attorney sent a demand letter to the moderator. The moderator then exploited free-speech bloggers and caused the BIG STORY to spread. Self-interest came into play - Reddit is owned by conde nast. Reddit benefits from awareness of reddit. Reddit can only exist if users are free to say whatever they want. Conde Nast also owns Ars Technica. Ars Technica wrote several blog posts about how horrible SE is for trying to suppress free speech on reddit. See how this works? Downstream lower-quality blogs regurgitated the free-speech story.

Two of the haters, now armed with SOURCES, took to Wikipedia and transformed this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suburban_Express&oldid;=542659074 into a very skewed mess. Then the problem became recursive - bloggers mentioned wikipedia, which led readers to trash the wikipedia page even more. Wiki editors cited the articles that cited wikipedia and the list of blogs that had covered the matter grew and grew. Now, the haters assert that the body of trash-news justifies giving the trash significant weight in the article - to the point where the real story of the company is pushed out. You can see this in corpm's proposed edit. He wants to remove from the lede the fact that the company was started by a student, and other key facts.

In any event, I applaud your efforts to move the article in a more academic direction, and I'm glad that someone with an econ background has arrived on-scene. You may find some stuff here interesting: http://www.toeppen.com

"BringIt

BringIt is a video gaming website that provides “gamers” the opportunity to connect over the internet and play one on one or multi-player tournaments against each other for money. The site was launched in November 2008 by Woodrow Levin.

In addition to the gaming provided, the website allows users to blog, create profiles and write reviews in the forums.  BringIt includes the following platforms: XBOX 360, PS2, PS3 and Wii.  The main page also provides gamers with a list of the games the website supports.

BringIt’s main page allows auto matches or allows gamers to select an opponent who is looking to play a specific game for the same dollar amount.  Players identify each other by their “gaming tag”, an online ID, and utilize their console’s online multiplayer platform or the built in multiplayer function of the game to play each other. When the game is completed, both players report the outcome to the website, or in the alternative result, emails are automatically reported from the game’s End of Game Email Reporting System. Winning players then have their account credited.  

Founder/Chief Executive Officer

Woodrow H. Levin founded InStadium and Riverbank Capital Management. Woodrow has been featured in Media Life Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, and has been a guest speaker at the University Of Wisconsin School Of Business. Woodrow received his B.A. in Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Juris Doctor from the Chicago-Kent School of Law. Woodrow is active in community and charitable organizations including JUF, Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation and most recently was on the executive committee of The Chicago Green Tie Ball.

How BringIt Works

All new gaming consoles and many older consoles are able to connect to the internet for multiplayer online game play. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo game consoles all have built in software which allows owners to play online against other gamers anywhere in the world. Each game will then be played through the existing technology of the console or game maker. 

Our Mission

BringIt is an online community where gamers across the globe can play video games for real money.  BringIt is a community of American and International gamers with the ability to play against each other 24 hours a day 7 days a week for real money.

Legal Aspects

BringIt is not in any violation of any United States or International anti-gambling laws currently in place. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that playing video games online are not games of chance; rather they are games of skill. Games of skill are not in violation of the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2006.  Users are required to be at least 18 years of age. Certain US State laws prohibit skill based game play and these residents may not compete in BringIt’s skill based video game tournaments.

Games which may be played through BringIt’s website for real money include:

Burnout Paradise
Call of Duty 4
Call of Duty World at War
COD4
Dead or Alive 4
Fifa 2009
Fight Night Round 3,4
Forza 2
Gears of War 2

"The Edit War on This Article 

Like myself, fans of Ms. Michaels are no doubt distressed by the petty actions of two Wikipedia usersMarauder40 and Hullaballoo Wolfowitzwho keep undoing my edits to this article. These two users constantly revert my edits with the claim that the article is too Peacock-y, and that it goes into too much depth about Ms. Michaels by detailing her rounds on the talk show circuit. I whole heartedly disagree. I think that her work on the various talk shows is some of the funniest, most impressive work of her career; and it is no small feat to appear on Ed Sullivan and The Tonight Show, let alone perform as well as she did. I hope the two editors who keep changing this article will realize this, and I encourage both of them to consider the possibility that only they, out of the countless editors on Wikipedia, have had any objections to the information on Ms. Michaels posted over the years. I don't know what their beef is with her, or if they have even seen any of her fine performances, but it would be appropriate for them to learn more about her before destroying the information about her on this free online encyclopedia.",0

Dispute(s)
(*Note to NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, AND ISSDC contributors: Please advise if you concur or disagree with my summaries below):

From everything I have read, it would appear, as evidenced throughout this talk page AND the article edit page, contributors representing the NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, and ISSDC registries/clubs, have agreed/compromised/concurred regarding the following:

1)They have agreed/compromised to the inclusion of ALL currently established registries/clubs affiliated with the Shiloh Shepherd dog, including the ISSR/SSDCA as an acknowledged Shiloh Shepherd registry/club in the article.

2)They have agreed/compromised that the article contain an acknowledgement that Ms. Barber initiated this breed and originated the standard for the breed.

3)They concur that the article content must contain """"verifiable"""" documentation, not based on """"original"""" research and stated only from a """"neutral point of view"""", in agreement with Wikipedia's stated requirements for content criteria.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria)

4)They have agreed/compromised, in order to resolve this dispute and prevent potential for unverifiable, dependent, biased inclusions/comparisons/contrasts by any registry/club, including their own, to refrain from including any registry/club specific information and promotion in the article, other than to cite the existence and names of each, and to simply include ALL registry's/club's homepage website links at the bottom of the article, which will allow Wikipedia readers the opportunity to gain access, should they choose, to each of the various registries'/clubs' individual purported documentation, research, and points of view. 

5)They concur that the article should NOT contain original publication of """"original thought"""", """"propaganda"""", """"advocacy"""", """"self-promotion"""", and """"advertising"""", in agreement with Wikipedia's stated requirements for """"Wikipedia: What Wikipedia is Not"""" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine).

6)They have agreed/compromised, in order to resolve this dispute and prevent inclusion of these disallowed contents by any registry/club, including their own, to refrain from including any registry/club specific information and promotion in the article, other than to cite the existence and names of each, and to simply include ALL registry's/club's homepage website links at the bottom of the article, which will allow Wikipedia readers the opportunity to gain access, should they choose, to each of the various registries'/clubs' individual thoughts, propaganda, advocacy, self-promotion, and advertising.

7)In order to resolve this dispute and prevent bias regarding the article's descriptive contents concerning """"Health"""", they have agreed/compromised to refrain from including any statements citing, reviewing, or comparing/contrasting ISSR, NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, SSDCA, or ISSDC health practices/policies and they propose the """"Health"""" section of the article contain only a statement listing those health issues acknowledged by ALL registries/clubs (gastrointestinal problems -gastric torsion/bloat, bacterial overgrowth syndrome- and skeletal or bone disorders such as hip dysplasia, panosteitis and osteochondritis), a recommendation by ALL registries/clubs that testing be conducted and a statement that """"these reports clearly show that, as giant breeds go, the Shiloh is arguably a healthy example"""".
 
8)They have agreed/compromised that regarding """"Size"""", """"Coat"""", """"Color"""", and """"Temperament"""", there appears to be very limited dispute re: the """"standards"""" contained therein and that the section should remain free of any statements citing, reviewing, promoting any individual registry/club and comparing/contrasting one registry/club with another.

These compromises and requested article inclusions/exclusions meet Wikipedia's policies/procedures for content criteria, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Wikipedia_content_criteria) in that they embrace the following:

1) Neutral(WP:NPOV)in that the article would be """"representing all views fairly and without bias""""  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). In FACT, there are no requests from the NSBR, TSSR, SSBA, and ISSDC registries/clubs for the inclusion of any comparisons/contrasts (negative or otherwise) between any of the registries/clubs, including the ISSR/SSDCA,  nor have they requested that any clubs other than their own, be exluded from inclusion in the article.  In FACT, there has only been the request that ALL registries/clubs affiliated with the Shiloh Shepherd dog be simply noted, with appropriate website links included at the bottom of the art",0

Linux vs GNU/Linux

2004-05-31 23:45, Hi David Gerard

You seem to have removed all the clarifications of the previously vague text.  Encyclopedia's should be impartial and correct.  You have put back all the confused use of """"Linux"""", and removed spelling/grammar corrections.  Really the Linux distributions entry should be clear about what it is and impartial to any of your leanings.  The version you have reverted to is an umbrella description which could be read as matching more than it in fact does.  The text should reflect correct and actual use of the term, including any that others may consider incorrect; it just should not blot out either/or as it does mostly at present.

Ok, and for the other minor revisions you removed:

eg -> e.g.
(""""eg"""" is just incorrectly spelt, e.g. is the abbreviation of latin """"exampli gratia"""" and should be written """"e.g."""" see OED for reference please.)

predetermined -> pre-determined

preconfigure -> pre-configure
(requires hyphen as conjoined words)

PCs -> IBM compatible PCs
(PCs is an abbreviation of """"Personal Computers"""", this case only refers to IBM compatible PCs.  Not Apple PCs for example.  So presently )

""""..targeted for China."""" -> """".. targeted at the Chinese market.""""
(grammar is simply wrong)

In the Xandros section:
commercial -> proprietary
(Are you unaware that GNU/Linux is typically commercial so the """"commercial"""" point is irrelevant, the relevant point is that it is PROPRIETARY commercial software.  There is  no point emphasising  a pointless piece of information.)

cooperation -> co-operation
(requires hyphen as conjoined words)

If you hold some position of seniority here please consider putting my clarifications back in.  At least consider the grammatical and spelling revisions if you are intent on the """"Linux"""" use being unsuitable as present.

Glad to see you did not revert my Proprietary software revision.

My comments in this post are intended to be polite, please do not consider my explanations patronising.

Cheers, now3d

I don't hold a position of editorial seniority; there isn't any such thing. However, the Linux to GNU/Linux stuff is clearly partisanism and POV-pushing. Please reread Talk:Linux and Talk:GNU/Linux naming controversy. And NPOV. In English, """"Linux"""" is far and away the most common name for what you (and I) would prefer to be called """"GNU/Linux""""; pretending it isn't would not (to my mind) be appropriate.

Typos: """"eg"""" you're right on, the others I think are arguable either way. I'll have a look through -  13:00, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I've had a go. The facts seem more or less in order (I could dispute a few bits), but the whole article is really badly written and needs serious rewriting by someone who's a good writer in English. I'll make an attempt later, but anyone else who wants a go is of course welcome ...

In the distro list, I've attempted to avoid Linux vs GNU/Linux by sticking to the word """"distribution"""", and only included one or the other when it's part of the name or when GNU is actually optional (does Linux from Scratch still tell you how to use BusyBox and uClibc, for instance?).

Further work on this article is desperately needed, and I mean a lot more than tweaks of hyphenation -  16:48, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Thank you for applying those gramatical revisions.  I just added co-operation. Regards, User:Now3d

""""I would like to offer my opinion. The project to excise all references to GNU/Linux is deeply POV and wrong. It should be reverted completely and totally as quickly as possible.

I had already known that Lancombz was behind the same firewall because he is indirectly responsible for my getting involved with Wikipedia.  However, we have only a slight acquaintance and it is not a relationship of equals, making it difficult for me to compel him to do anything at all.  Furthermore, he left Wikipedia in a huff weeks ago over the behavior of the very same people now hounding me.  When I contacted him earlier today to ask for his advice and assistance, he only insisted that Wikipedia was corrupt, incompetent and a waste of his time.  He used less polite words than that, making it clear that the matter was closed, as he saw it.

I do not know who FreddyTris is, and though """"Fred"""" is a common name, it is not to be found around here.  I do not see much chance of his aiding me because he is an ardent Objectivist and has shown an active disdain for Wikipedia administration, to the point where he caught Mr. Wolfer in a 3RR violation but chose not to report it.

There is an atmosphere of a witch hunt here and the matter is spiraling out of control.  ,  and some anonymous user have all defaced my user page.  This has also taken place on Freddy's page and Lan's, both with suspiciously anonymous users joining in.  Otheus has demanded that Lancombz apologize and make promises, but of course this requires Lan to return to Wikipedia, which I doubt will ever occur.

The attacks include a number of malicious revert wars outside of user pages.  Mike has reverted Freddy's edit of Ayn Rand with a dishonest comment and is clearly taunting him.  It appears to be working, given Freddy's angry responses.  Along with , Mike is doing much the same on Objectivism (Ayn Rand), leaving intentionally false edit comments.  I fully expect Freddy to lose his temper and go amok at any moment.  The locus of this insanity is , where they are spinning tales linking me to still other users.  They started with , but are now trying to expand it to   and perhaps others.

What we have here is a group of users trying to take over all of the articles related to Ayn Rand, using intimidation, administrator manipulation and outright deceit to get their way.  Lan might have been short-tempered, but he was clearly not delusional. At this point, I am frustrated and disgusted by the state of affairs and want only for this foolishness to come to an end.  Can you do something about this?

=====

The Wikipedia article on Federal Vision shows a strong flavor of bias, because it does not clearly describe Federal Vision's distinctive, and often contested, meanings for various Christian theological words and phrases of long standing; and because it omits an adequately clear summary of the most common criticisms of FV.

The neutrality of the article can be strengthened in at least two ways. One way is clarify the new definitions that certain Federal Visionists have created for certain established theological terms and phrases. For example, the Federal Vision's view of """"covenant objectivity"""" results in a category of person some have called the """"unbelieving Christian"""" or """"unsaved Christian"""", which most evangelicals regard as an oxymoronic statement. 

Federal Visionists assert a belief in election, but subdivide the elect between elect who are granted an additional grace of perseverance and thus persevere in their faith unto eternal life, as opposed to a different category of the elect who are not granted a special grace of perseverance by God, and as a result apostasize from the Christian faith and are eternally condemned to hell. 

The phrase """"obedient faith"""" has been adopted from controversial CRC pastor Rev. Norman Shepherd, and is used to signify that one is justified not by faith alone (that is, faith in Jesus Christ and the Gospel, considered apart from its subjective ethical influences), but by the consequent actions of ethical obedience to God's will which result from faith.

This brings us to a second way to make the Wikipedia article neutral, which is to add a clear section on basic criticisms of Federal Vision. 

The link section addresses some of these, but there ought to be material in the body of the article itself that enumerates and clearly describes the most common criticisms of Federal Vision. E.g., Federal Vision has been criticized as not being properly described as """"evangelical"""" (since """"evangelical"""" denotes a Protestant insistence on the necessity of individual conversion), in light of its teaching of presumptive baptismal regeneration, and continual criticism (and sometimes mockery) of American evangelicalism's emphasis on the encessity of conversion. In this sense, it appears to be more akin to high Anglicanism, which is non-evangelical. The claim that it more faithfully represents the thought of John Calvin is disputed by many familiar with Calvin's theology.

 African Americans are multiracials 
Countless studies and research have shown that African Americans aren't pure blacks, like you would find in Africa, but multiracials. They have Native American and Caucasoid in their ancestry, from being raped and what have you. Technically speaking, they are a completely separate race from """"Black people"""", as they aren't pure blacks. The only reason they're often categorized as such is because of the One-Drop rule. Shouldn't this fact be noted in the heading of the article. At least something about them being multiracials as opposed to pure blacks? 66.175.204.183    —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.175.200.14   

That's because """"race"""" varies over a fairly smooth space of variable phenotypes and two races are described as different when there is a discontinuity.  That is to say, before civilized times, one was not really able to tell the difference between one's neighbors, and one was rather unlikely to encounter people who looked substantially different until more modern and effective means of transportation and higher population densities allowed for it.  Your views on racial mixing """"creating a new race"""" is bizarre, since it takes race to be an immutable and discrete classification system.  This is the same kind of fallacy that leads one to ask for the """"missing link"""" for evolution.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.7.82.22   

What do you mean by all that bombastic rigmarole?! I am stating a very simple truth, which is that African Americans are a mixed race because we have Caucasoid, Native American, and Negroid in us. People might wonder to themselves how can Tisha Campbell be black or Negroid when she doesn't look black by any stretch of the imagination. The answer is simple: because she's African American and skin colors range all across the board in the African American community. I have several people in my family who are the color of Tisha Campbell and that's because African Americans are NOT Negroids. We're multiracials. Research has been done proving this; not to mention, I have proof within my family tree. 66.175.201.77  """,0

 Carol Kivler testimonial and mechanism of action 

I have removed new content on the mechanism of action and an endorsement from Carol Kivler.  Medical content on Wikipedia is strictly governed by guidelines and policies. I'm not sure the Kliver testimonial, or any testimonial, is appropriate for an evidence-based article. A very important guideline is Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine). The source (Perrin et al.) for the mechanism of action content does not conform to that guideline.

Perrin et al., an fMRI study of ECT and frontal cortical connectivity in severe depressive disorder, is not appropriate for the claims the new text makes. Per the guideline I linked to above, we rely on expert reviews to put such results into context. This study can be mentioned once a review has done that, if the review gives it sufficient importance to warrant inclusion.

Also, it's important to be very precise in paraphrasing sources. The recent edit said, """"The group's findings confirmed the hyperconnectivity hypothesis of ECT"""" which is stronger than the source's """"The findings reported here add weight to the emerging “hyperconnectivity hypothesis” in depression...""""  

I'm not contesting the veracity of any of the content. But to be included in Wikipedia, the relevance and accuracy of all medical content must be supported by sources that conform to the above guideline - usually systematic reviews, graduate-level textbooks, national or international professional guidelines, or similar, that can be expected to accurately reflect the current scholarly consensus.

Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences”. User:Bobrayner wipes out “surplus economics”, “archaeology”, “sociology” and “other social sciences” so that the  sentence now reads: “Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology” (in that case, it should really be “AND economic anthropology”). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a “quote farm” or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that “For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below).” There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out “the statement that “Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion.” For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence “The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour” and adds, “In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour.” But this doesn’t even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed,” then User:Bobrayner changes that to “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has",0

"4. Lancaster, PA, September 1777, for only one day?
5. York, PA, September 1777, to use Susquehanna river as defense against British
6. Princeton, NJ
7. Annapolis, MD
8. Trenton, NJ
9. New York, NY
10. Philadelphia
11. Washington, D.C.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

 The debate appears to be skewed. 

It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages """"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate"""" and """"Self-organization"""" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.

Nordic cinema
HI. These are exciting times are they not? What I had in mind two years ago on here seems to be gradually taking shape. The project is better and more organised than ever. I;m particularly pleased with the Nordic task force and the devleopment of articles such as A Victim of the Mormons. Who;d have ever though in the olden days we would have a half decent article on a] a 1911 film and b] a silent danish movie. If we can add such content en masse which are of s similar standard this project will devleop massively. Some day we'll have every notable film from every country, and up to a half decent standard (hopefully). I;m keen to encourage editors to edit Latin American film although this seems to be a sadly neglected part of films on here. I;ve proposed a new project but I doubt I'll get anybody to follow it as most interested editors are likely to be working on spanish wikipedia aside from the one or two film buffs we have on here. Anyway just to tell you I proposed and with Her Peghsip got Category:Danish film stubs up and running.

"Zondervan 

Thanks for the feedback. One point I'd like to make, however:

The main controversy surrounding Zondervan is somewhat of an internal affair to Christianity: the controversy is entirely over whether or not Zondervan should be trusted, seeing as it is owned by a secular media company. I would suppose that secular sources would be rather unlikely to pick up on the story, seeing how it is mostly irrelevant to those unconcerned with Christianity and the state of one of its publishers. From the (admittedly horrible) site http://www.kingdombaptist.org/new-bible-versions-and-the-growing-pornographic-industry/ 
Let’s examine this from another angle. Has News Corp. always allowed their subsidiaries to operate autonomously? While driving the other day I happened to hear a bit of the Marlin Maddox radio program. They main topic was the remark that the younger Murdock made concerning Falon Gong and China (I am surprised no one called in to comment on the NIV.) They were enraged at the Murdocks for “selling out” and turning a blind eye to the sufferings of the people under Communism. China represents the world’s largest media market. It is five times larger than the U.S. market. The Murdocks do not want to do anything to disrupt cashing in on that market. Marlin Maddox had an interview with a man who fled China; he had been dropped from a HarperCollins publishing deal because his important book was speaking out against the Chinese. The U.S. News reported in 1998:
“The scandal that could have far-reaching repercussions involved HarperCollins, a unit of News Corp. The publishing house last month dropped a book by Christopher Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. The ostensible reason was that the writing was inadequate. But the
action fit a pattern of Murdoch’s adjusting editorial policies so as not to offend the Chinese leadership in Beijing. Murdoch’s News Corp. has invested heavily in a satellite broadcasting business based in Hong Kong and eventually hopes to be able to beam programming to mainland China’s huge population. Murdoch denied ordering that the book be dropped. But a memo by HarperCollins Chairman Eddie Bell, which surfaced last week, indicated otherwise: ‘Murdoch has outlined to me the negative aspects of publication, which I fully understand,’…After being pilloried in newspapers, Murdoch issued a limited apology to Patten for any suggestion that his book had been rejected for “being too boring.” HarperCollins later reached an out-of-court financial settlement with Patten, who had threatened to sue the publishing house…During the HarperCollins contretemps, potentially damaging remarks on China by a former Times writer also came to light. ‘The Times has simply decided, because of Murdoch’s interests, not to cover China in a serious way,’ Jonathan Mirsky, the paper’s former East Asian editor, said at a conference in January, according to a transcript that recently appeared on the Internet.” (3-23-98)
Thus, the “top” does control the bottom – when it cares to. And why not? A man ought to have right to control his businesses in whatever manner he chooses. And we ought to have the right to REJECT anything associated with the pornographic industry!
You can see how such an issue would both be a controversy, and something unlikely to be covered by many secular news outlets.",0

18-ethoxycoronaridine
Hi Edgar. Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   
The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) 
Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   
Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds",0
"More rubbish. This page contains 0.000001% of the actual amount of news coverage there's been of the Olympics, so that claim is clearly nonsense. There are no differing interpretations here at all, there's people talking about policies that they know about, and then there's you, who can barely even match up a policy to the issue it governs - NOTABILITY doesn't control content in articles, RECENT doesn't bar the inclusion of recent incidents, NOTNEWS doesn't forbid the use of journalistic sources, WP:ILIKEIT only applies to deletion debates, etc etc etc. You can claim all you want that incidents weren't controversial, but merely pointing out that the word 'controversial' isn't in the source is about the thinnest argument you could ever produce to support it (and in the case of Kim Collins, it's actually a lie, there are soucres calling it controversial, I don't think you even bother looking half the time).",1

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page!

"""

And what do """"quanta"""" and """"cosmology"""" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as """"the study of everything"""" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain """"bulk"""" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.""",0

The eastern Montana thing is going to be tricky; there was a boom just like now in the 70s-80s, and a subsequent crash, the pattern is significant, not necessarily a permanent thing.

 Article Structure 

Okay, so there seems to be no basic consensus on how this article should be structured.  I can't find an outline in the wikiprojects sections, so I am going to attempt to make one based on the the only three states at FA-Class Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Virginia and the nearest GA-Class article, South Dakota.  Yes, we're being beaten by South Dakota.  Here is my suggestion: 

Etymology — (see OK's) — Short description of where the name Montana comes from
Geography — (see SD's) — General descriptions about size and location
Geology and terrain — Junk about east v west, mountains, rivers, etc.  Just not a bunch of lists
Flora and fauna — kind of obvious; may need to break state into regions  
Climate
Protected lands — State and national parks, I guess.
History — Summarize and send off to the History of Montana page
American Indian reservations — Brief overview and description of the Indian reservations in Montana.  Could be linked here until a separate page can be made.
Cities and Towns — (See OK's) — Briefly describe the make-up of Montana's cities and towns.  Not a giant list. There's already one here, just send people there.  Really, only those with more than 50,000 should be listed on this page, but given that doesn't even include the capital we may as well go down to Kalispell at around 20,000 (i.e. the largest seven).  No other town even has 10,000.  We're not exactly waiting up on election night for the Havre votes to come in.
Demographics — Basic census crap written in prose
Population
Ancestry
Religion
Economy
Culture — (see OK's and (VA's))
Arts and theatre — We have plenty of museums and theatres across the state.  You could list the most important ones first, but eventually they need to be put into prose.
Festivals and events — Ditto
Sports and recreation
Organized sports — Probably mostly college sports and minor league baseball.  Could add state games and skiing competitions I guess.
Outdoor recreation — hiking, fishing, mountain biking, skiing, etc.
Government and politics — (see OK's)
State government
Local government
Tribal government
National Politics
Education — School districts, administration, universities/colleges, etc.
Media — (see OK's and SD's) — Links to lists should be okay, but here only the largest and prominent should be mentioned as well as Nielsen zones, etc.
Health — (see VA's and OK's) — MT's healthcare system, stats, and perhaps main hospitals.
Transportation — (see OK's) — Basic info from the MDOT on our roads, train stations, and airports.  And, the basic health of our transportation system.
State symbols — (see VA's)

Any Comments?
  

Thanks for the list, Dsetay  (you forgot to sign it above) No question the article is not of good quality and needs to be improved.  I don't have a lot of time to devote to this, but I'd support and offer minor assistance to an improvement drive. The Oklahoma or Minnesota articles would probably be the best guides, as both have notable Native American populations and are more or less in the west.  SD would be fine to fill in gaps, but GA being a less fussy standard than FA, I'd split any debates in favor of an FA structure.  [[User talk:Montanabw|",0

 User:Slrubenstein and other's falsifying and defamatory edits 

User:Slrubenstein who obviously does not like the word 'theory' (and didn't like the article from the beginning) has repeatedly edited the article adding falsifying terms like 'proposal' instead. Nowhere does Carotta """"propose"""" or """"claim"""" anything. Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out. He has not answered the questions raised by someone above concerning his problems with this article either.

Now this excellent User:Slrubenstein has even gone so far as to """"protect"""" (i.e. block, prevent editing) the article altogether. I think everyone involved in this or just reading here should seriously ask themselves whether User:Slrubenstein who canvassed against the article, voted for stong delete and most emphatically defamed the author as """"crackpot"""" (this might be actionable), is the right person to further work on this article let alone be an admin in control of it.

User:Rbreen who also voted for strong delete and who has already been convicted of lying and destorting scholarly statements above, now thinks he is the appropriate authority to judge on Carotta's undeniable and never before denied classical scholarship. He obviously knows better than reputable scholars like Piñero, Canfora, Kavoukopoulos, Simon and others. Here's your typical Wikipedia editor.

Nothing new can be said of User:Iblardi either. He helps wherever he can to degrade the article and defame its subject.

User:EALacey is not even capable (or is he not willing?) to correctly translate the word """"Wissenschaftsparodie"""" into English. The correct translation is """"science parody"""". Another typical WP editor, it seems.

"Inconsistencies regarding the alleged hoaxes. 

The article includes three entries under UFO hoaxes.  Two of those entries have Wikipedia pages, but if you check those pages, there's no proof offered that they are indeed hoaxes.

I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail, since he fears some kind of academical threat. Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went """"India did not exist until 1947"""". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong... Indrancroos

Here is a new revised entry to go at the top of the """"Son of Perdition"""" page representing all of the mainstream interpretations of the term for comment.

(Mormon's need not comment as it is about the mainstream positions, and the Mormon position is already covered.)

________

""""Son of Perdition"""" edit

According to orthodox Jewish and Christian eschatological beliefs, and secular historians and scholars, the concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in Revelation  and ) is used in the Bible in one or more of three contexts, forming a triunism (or trinity,http://www.nathan.co.za/message.asp?sermonum=10 or typology) of three potential interpretive references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes

Many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt [see Book of Daniel]. These scholars say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the First Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc. Even those who advocate an interpretation of Daniel that includes the Roman Empire in their interpretations of Daniel recognize Antiochus as a prototype of """"antichrist.""""http://www.endtime-truth.com/studies2.html

In Revelation  and , John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" Revelation  by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. (Revelation ) The Greek name is """"Apollyon"""" (Greek: Aπολλυων), from the Greek root word """"apollumi"""" (Greek:απολλυμι) It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" [Strong's 622] The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon"""" (Greek: Aβαδδων), from the Aramaic root word """"'abad"""" (Hebrew transliteration:שׁא), which means the same thing as the Greek root word. [Strong's 07] Daniel  says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be slain, and his body """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (generally accepted by religious scholars to be a reference to hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.

Third frame of reference: Antichrist

In 2 Thessalonians , Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to """"the Son of Perdition"""" in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. He also equated this person with the Man of Sin.

Likewise, In Revelation  and , John, writing well after Jesus and Judas Iscariot had come and gone to their respective destinies, refers to """"the beast that goeth into perdition."""" Assuming a futuristic mode of interpretation, this would also be a reference to a future figure.

In some variations of Christian eschatology, this future figure is commonly referred to as """"antichrist,"""" the """"false messiah,"""" or the """"false christ.""""

 Followup re TPm case voting, etc 

Courcelles, as your response to my previous query failed to answer the question as to why you would vote on the my topic ban the same day that the FoF was posted by AGK versus your statement to Malke that the """"last thing you needed to do"""" was to vote on her topic ban, etc., I'm wondering what your history of interaction on Wikipedia with Malke has been in the past.

Since it was raised on the Evidence pageby meyou cannot not have been aware of the fact that she was sanctioned for similar behavior in 2010. You also must have been aware of the fact that she had accused me several times of being a sockpuppet of Dylan somebody-or-other, and made other strange assertions, as I detailed on the Evidence page. You seem to have ignored all of the above in your vote regarding sanctions against Malke, and voted for sanctions against me before any discussion of the FoF had even had a chance to take place.

So, I am investigating you, independently, as it were. You may find that amusing, but I have just explained the rationale, and I hope you take me seriously. 

If you'd care to explain what you found most offensive in my editing conduct on that article, it might save me the time an effort of examining your interaction history with Malke to see whether or not maybe you should have recused yourself from the case altogether, or at least from voting on Malke, as NYB did (recuse himself). 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

 Removal of poorly sourced claims about vegetarianism 

The article currently says, 
The Economist in an article writes that some Uruguayans see him as """"a roly-poly former guerrilla who grows flowers on a small farm and swears by vegetarianism"""", but he is not vegetarian.

The source that claims Mujica is not a vegetarian is dubious; it appears to be an opinion piece by someone who opposes the president's lifestyle.

"Rajarata was abundant due to regular wars for the Rajarata land. Sinhalese kings tried to re established Rajarata, but they weren't allowed by Pandyan empire. They had full control of the Sri Lanka in 1450. They got real opportunity after 235 years from the Tamil invasion. That time people adjusted to wet zone so it is possible that descendants of the engineering families didn't had the practical knowledge to rebuild the dry zone hydraulic system. It wasn't that much simple. Even British couldn't understand how the system works. 
So clear major reason is they were adjusted to a another system. Also non existence of expert knowledge to rebuild the system could help to not to go to dry zone again.  But clearly it is not enviornmental issues. It was run more than 15 centuries.
I don't see Magha is irrelavant here. Magha doesn't mean only Magha. He couldn't do all the things alone. He was supported by his army.
Even king didn't had child army had children. Those are the people who came to Jaffna.   

 pre History of Jaffna kingdom 

Jaffna was part of Rajarata before the collapse of Rajarata. Some people trying to say there was independent kingdom (convergence) Jaffna. But how there can be a kingdom without people ? People came with Magha's army. So due to what it could survive from the power of Rajarata ?   

 Starting point of Rajarata 
Magha is not the one who established Jaffna kingdom. Magha is the last king of Rajarata. People accept Magha as king as they couldn't find any royal blood at that time and Magha was Nissanka Malla relative. Also sinhalese power was very weak at that time due to regular providing of strong armies to assist Pandyan to servile from Cholas. Due to this Veera Pandyan a Pandyan prince who get help from Sinhalese and couldn't servive chola powers invaded weak (unstable due to internal conflicts for kingship) Pollonnaruwa. Then Kalinga Magha (Sinha) invaded Rajarata with army of Tamils. There was a battle Magha defeated Veera Pandyan. Magha was accepted as the king. But it wasn't sure whether Magha was controlled by his army chiefs. Armies destroyed Buddhist stupas (may be to find treasures). Also there wasn't way to feed large number of army. Therefore they expelled Sinhalese from north.
People go against the king (as they did to Mahasen) and fight against king. Magha had to abandon the Rajarata. This army wasn't big as previous chola armies. Previous occasions Rajarata rulers completely expelled previous chola invaders and those who wished to join  king was also allowed ( vellakkara group). But Magha's army had good support from Pandyan (It is not clear why Pandyan betrayed Sinhalese as Sinhalese regularly provided armies to survive from Cholas). Pandyan was just near Jaffna and able to respond very quickly. After repulse of Sinhalese Magha's descenders had to accept they obey Pandyan King. Pandyan ruled/assist jaffna with military family called as Aryachakravarthi. But in 1323 powerful Muslim empire destroyed Pandyan capital and captured the king. After Pandyan was ruled by Muslims. They didn't care to assist Jaffna. At this point Aryachkravarthi him self made as the king of Jaffna. 
It is not right to say Magha as the establisher of Jaffna kingdom. He was the king of Pollonnaruwa but after his death and tamil forces was expelled from Rajarata core areas to Jaffna they were under protection of the Pandyan king. So Arachakravarthi established the Jaffna Kingdom",0

I have reverently removed my yellowing copy of the Histoire militaire from my shelves, and blown the dust off the title page.  You are right that Aubert and Pasquier are mentioned on this page, but not as its authors.  Pasquier is merely mentioned as the governor of Cochinchina at the time, and even Aubert modestly assigns the authorship to his staff officers.  During the past seven years I have made a close study of both Histoire militaire and Conquête de l'Indochine, and there are so many verbal similarities that I am convinced that Thomazi (doubtless on Aubert's état-major) was the main author of Histoire militaire, even though he is not formally credited with it.  However, I have perhaps gone too far in formally attributing authorship to him.  Is it normally attributed to Aubert and Pasquier?  If so, I suppose I had better follow convention.",0

i'm enjoying the holiday. the nice thing about beating your head against the wall: it feels good when you stop. why should i put up with the sons of betacommand, when i can work at source with charles matthews? i am not alone, just go look at all the veteran editors at other projects who won't come back; look at all the expert editors, who stopped editing because they were bitten. this attitude that editors are a dime a dozen, is a limiting factor in the quality of wikipedia.

we have editors nominating for deletion, because a fair use image would make it harder to email and get a free image;
we have editors nominating for deletion, because in the era of digital cameras, a free image of the recently dead must exist, look harder; 
we have editors nominating for deletion, because an image in a book exists, go scan the book, (even it was printed in 1930, and the photographer is unknown) this image would be challenged at commons since the source and copyright status is unknown;
we have editors nominating for deletion, because the newspaper photo could be a commercial source although no proof of commercial source exists; 
we have admins removing fair use images from articles without discussion, then letting the bot delete the new """"orphan"""" image.

Redirect

I didn't redirect the article. What I said is that it probably should be. I'm happy that you're getting in there and editing and learning the ropes, but my personal opinion is that it should be redirected, and that is based on the idea that what's there is mostly about alternate states of consciousness and reality, and not really about the extrasensory clairsentience. I don't think there's enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page. 90% of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real. That's fine, but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself. The content about altered states of reality, etc. should probably go in an altered states of reality article instead of this particular article. I didn't, however, redirect it.

Strictly speaking, that image probably doesn't fit any speedy deletion criterion, although some may find it qualified under a more liberal interpretation of the CSD. My main justification for the deletion was a mixture of Ignore All Rules and the Snowball clause. To answer your question, you would – in all likelihood – not have been able to tag that image for speedy deletion and have an administrator that was judiciously following the criteria delete it.

"Australian club notability 2 

Hey Octopus, first and foremost, awesome work on creating a table of notability for football clubs and comps. Much appreciated by all, I'm sure. =)

I'm writing this to see about . A previous user messaged you about adding the old and proposed national cups in late 2012. Since then, two major changes have occurred in Australian Football. The first is not-surprisingly the development of the FFA Cup from a proposal, to a legitimate tournament. The second change is a little more subtle, but still extremely notable. The alignment of 8 of the 9 State Leagues into a national second division.

The updated version I'm suggesting is for the A-League (1), National Soccer League (1), National Premier Leagues (8) to be deemed notable. Your previous list also mentions the Brisbane Premier League (a third division) as notable.

I was also wondering if the following third division leagues (all containing promotion spots to the National Premier Leagues competitions) could also be deemed notable:
National Premier Leagues NSW 2 (12/12 clubs within this league have articles) (Note: This is the most prestigious third division competition in Australia).
National Premier Leagues Victoria 1 (20/20 clubs within this league have articles)
National Premier Leagues State League (16/16 clubs within this league have articles)

@Jytdog:  I agree with  that your personal views about how regulation works and how well it works is not relevant at all here, and it is a distraction.  Additionally, your definitions of """"mainstream"""" do not comport with Wikipedia.  Wikipedia defines Mainstream as follows:
Mainstream refers to a current of thought that is presently widespread.  It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media.
The mainstream popular majority view is that GMO's are not safe and should be labelled, and with your familiarity with the Genetically modified food controversies article, I'm sure you are well aware of that.  But I'll provide RS anyway.  For example:  [this].  Also, 93% of Americans think GMO's should be labelled according to this New York Times survey.  So the """"mainstream"""" view of GMO's, GMO safety and labeling and adequacy of regulation does not comport with your views of what """"mainstream"""" means.
We all know that Wikipedia is not going to report the mainstream view as if it were a fact, because the public can be wrong and so can the media.  So Wikipedia relies instead on the """"mainstream scholarship"""" WP:VALID or """"mainstream scientists"""" WP:PSCI as experts, not the public and not the views of civil servant regulators, farmers, firefighters or lawyers who are """"in the trenches"""".  This bizarre tangent saying that low level regulators are mainstream """"experts"""" is not helpful to improving the article, because it has nothing to with WP:RS and WP:PAG.

Please provide solid RS to back up your objections and assertions, rather than giving personal opinions and expecting us to trust your views are solidly based on RS, especially when RS is provided that says otherwise.

You have agreed that the sentence needs revision, and you have been asked a number of times to provide an alternative sentence, which you think would gain consensus, and I have yet to see it.

 PREP vs. Quick Count 

The text of the article suggests (and states overtly at least once) that the PREP and the Quick Count are the same thing. They are most definitely not. 

The Quick Count (""""Conteo Rapido"""", as opposed to the PREP, """"Programa the Resultados Electorales Preliminares""""), was a statistical sampling model of several polling places. It was meant as a statistical tool of prediction. The results from the Quick Count, which were made public some days later, showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three, but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside. It was because of this, as per prior agreement, that the IFE declared the race too close to call (the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido, or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results, or declare the race too close to call). The Quick Count was not the PREP. As it happens, the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results.

The PREP on the other hand is the quick dissemination of full results as reported by the district electoral councils to the IFE. There is no statistical component to the PREP, as opposed to the Quick Count which is an entirely statistical analysis of results.

See for example , in which Ugalde speaks of making the results from the Quick Count known, and whether the tecnical committee felt it would be possible to determine the electoral tendencies at the time.  Another note is in:

"The new picture cinches itGood work 

The new picture of Lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle and other incriminating evidence is much better than the similar one that was in the article.  See, Exhibit 746-A from the Warren Commission.

The new picture is much darker and conceals the apparent  fabrication of the photo as complained about by Oswald before he was shot. 

We have to keep in mind that the fabrication of photographs back in 1963 was still rather primitive.  The similar pictures that the Warren Commission had available are either blow ups of the picture (which are too revealing or have disastrous results), or the print is not dark enough to conceal the cut and paste job on the face of which Oswald  complained.  See, for example Warren Commission Ex 746-C with the face pasted on at the level of the chin. 

It was also a wise choice not to use Exhibit 749 because it has that embarrassing oversight where someone drew in what appeared to be the butt of the gun stock for another photograph and re-used it with the triangular piece of gun stock still drawn in. (See, third picket from Oswald's leg).

 The Gamergate Conspiracy 

We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a """"controversy,"""" as we do now, or as a """"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.

A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.

A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.

We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.

“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.

But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    """,0

 Thoughts on a """"high school"""" A7 

As I am, of course, well aware following my RfA, CSD A7 explicitly exempts schools.  Do you believe that it applies to """"online"""" schools; specifically, Denver Online High School?  I just removed the speedy deletion template, though I'm not really sure it qualifies for the exception.  Looking at their webpage (just added as an EL to the article), it looks like they probably are real, and seem at least somewhat connected to the Denver public school system (though they also seem to charge fees, which confuses me).  If the are operated by the State, then they probably even meet the general """"All high schools are automatically notable"""" AfD exemption.  

Obviously, the article needs clean-up, but I'd rather wait and see if it should even be an article before doing so.   
This is indeed  a public school, though private high schools are just as notable as public ones. (I don't see a mention of fees, but most public schools do collect some sort of fee, and almost all charge tuition to students from outside their district.) The article however was totally unacceptablemainly devoted to the names of the teachers. I removed that, but there is still much necessary rewriting.  The real question for an online school at this or any level  would be whether it is actually a separate school, or merely a programwe cannot necessarily go by the name it calls itself. If a program, it would best go in the article for the Denver Board of Education. My feeling is that it an actual  separate school, but for something like this, a 3rd party reference will be really helpful.  What it clearly is not is a mere tutoring center or support facility, which are almost never notable.   ' ( talk ) 
That all sounds very reasonable to me; I figured erring on the side of caution (removing the A7) was the better choice.  Thanks for the trimming; I'll go take a look and see if I can find any sort of third party sources.    

 Notability of high schools 

Hi  I hope you have been well.  I seem to recall, and have stated (or mis-stated, as the case may be) that I thought you may have said in the past that (verifiable) high schools are generally presumptively notable.  But, in the event I've mis-spoken as to what you said, feel free to correct me.  I made mention of my recollections at an AfD where I've not myself !voted (as of yet), here:  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel.  Best.  
such is the accepted compromise: high schools have articles, elementary schools in the absence of special notability get merged. But the compromise , like all informal and formal Wikipedia rules, has effect only as long as people here want it to have effect. I think recent decisions have upheld this in general, but there are always one or two people who challenge it. Such is probably the case here,There may be other factors, though, which I mention them at the AfD. ' ( talk ) 

Inherent notability for elementary schools which have been """"Blue Ribbon Schools""""
I am contacting you because you participated in either the AFD Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in a redirect or the deletion review Wikipedia:Deletion review#Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in restoration of the article because it was once a """"Blue Ribbon School"""". I have opened a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Notability (organizations and companies)#US elementary schools: Inherent notability: for """"Blue Ribbon Schools"""" as to whether the 5200 schools which have been found awarded the """"Blue Ribbon"""" seal of approval get inherent notability, or if they each have to satisfy WP:ORG via significant coverage in multiple reliable and independent sources. Your input is welcome. Thanks!    
P.S. Should I have made this a """"RFC?"""" I rarely get involved in such general policy forums.   
the way we've been doing it recently, it would best be to be made an RfC. But it should not be worded """"inherent notability """" but """"presumption of notability"""", and, personally, though I care relatively little for these articles one way or anot",0

 Edit request from Ari14850, 6 January 2011 

The third paragraph says Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse. This is a substantive error.

Courthouse as one word refers to the actual court house in a village or town. The surrender actually occurred at the McLean house (it was purposefully not done in the actual Court House so as to avoid giving it a legal imprimatur - formally recognizing the confederacy which the union never did.

The correct text should read """"Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865"""". It is correctly spelled later in the article (general in cheif section, 2nd para)

"Weak support:This came to my attention when I started in doing a disambiguation back when The Nation went to The Nation (disambiguation).  It is true (this is also said above) that the majority of links which went to The Nation (disambiguation) were meant to go to The Nation (U.S. periodical).  However, I found that in all the cases where this was not true (e.g. when the Irish or Thai periodical was meant) the editors of those articles seemed to not be aware of the U.S. periodical.  (This makes sense, incidentally, as this periodical is not entirely well known even in the U.S.)  In short, the old situation was that there were a ton of links to a disambiguation page, which is to be avoided, but in this new situation, I think we'll eventually see a ton of links to simply the wrong thing, which strikes me as worse.
Moreover, a remark:  although the majority of the inbound links were meant for the U.S. periodical, I think there is a systemic bias at work here.  A vast majority of those were in bibliographies, where a web article from The Nation was referenced.  Many (almost all?) sources in Wikipedia bibliographies are web-based, and thus we should not be surprised to see a current magazine overrepresented, especially when constrasted with a 19th century publication.

I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA, though it's not relevant in connection with the present article.  Yes, I would personally view the BMA as a pro-choice advocacy group.

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.

However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""  RCOG has not only opposed reductions in abortion time limits, but has also sought to """"make abortions easier and faster.""""

For willmcw

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

[left unsigned by user:Steve espinola at ]

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0

 Borges' Apocryphal Quote 

Is """"apocryphal"""" the correct word.  In Royce's The World and the Individual, available on Archive.org, he begins a discussion (in the Supplemental Essay) as follows: """"let us suppose, if you please, that a portion of the surface of England is very perfectly levelled and smoothed, and is then devoted to the production of our precise map of England. That in general, then, should be found upon the surface of England, map constructions which more or less roughly represent the whole of England, — all this has nothing puzzling about it. Any ordinary map of England spread out upon English ground would illustrate, in a way, such
possession, by a part of the surface of England, of a resemblance to the whole. But now suppose that this our resemblance is to be made absolutely exact, in the sense previously defined.""""  Royce goes on for awhile.

Borges may have massaged, and shortened considerably, the quote, but the idea is still Royce's (it is also discussed in Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy).

The fact that the area is a suburban part of the Tucson metro area has some informative value for our readers as it suggests the kind of connection it has to the city of Tucson, and informs our readers of the nature of the area = that it is a residential area, not a downtown business area, not the countryside, not an inner city area, etc.  """"Unincorporated"""" as you added to the daughter article is a political distinction and similarly not particularly informative in the context of this article.

The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

First off,  T.N.E. has always had a strong division in its organization early on. If you happen to be T.N.E. from Wesleyan today, you probalbly know very little about all the details of the organization. You are basing it on Wesleyans records alone, while I am using both sources from both Alfa chapters. I'm sorry if you don't like that reality, or if you want to believe that the T.N.E. that you know of today is the correct or only version of the society, but that is simply not historically true, and Purdue is even mentioned as """"Indiana Alpha"""" within Wesleyan's own current T.N.E. website. T.N.E. has also sufferered greatly from disorganization by these two Alphas, and the T.N.E. of Purdue today that requires tapped membership has nothing to do with the T.N.E. organization of Weslyans Alpha Chapter. I even suspect that there may be a second T.N.E. chapter at Purdue that is associated with Weslyan's current outfit.  T.N.E. of Wesleyan now is acting much more like a social fraternity than a traditional secret society of Skull & Bones, and yes, Purdue's chapter was established on the 50th anniversary of Skull and Bones as an important engineering and aviation branch. It is believed that Neil Armstrong, the first person that walked on the moon, was T.N.E of tapped Purdue membership. Moreover, If you want to believe that the page as it stands in your version is correct, why than is both Purdue and Bodoin  listed as the same name, """"Alphs Alpha"""", how can this be possible? It is so becuase the Wesylian branch never had accurate records of Purdue Alpha. Also, the waterdowned version of T.N.E. that you know of today is really a start up after a substantial period of inactivity. I suspect, that at best, the mainstreamed version of T.N.E. that you know of may have some secrets of the organization's original initiation rights preserved, but have lost all of the more substatial secrets of the society, secrets that unfortunately were never recorded but passed on by verbal means from generation to generation in the same mannner of Skull and Bones today. This is why the current T.N.E. claims in their website that there are no true secrets to T.N.E., but it is more accurate to say that there are no true secrets to Weslyan's T.N.E. outfit as it stands today. This is not to say that T.N.E. or even Skull & Bones have some sort of conspiracy, but there were definetly early American secrets about the culture of this nation's forefathers that were kept private, secrets that were Masonic in tradition that both S & B and Purdue's group have maintained. That bond of trust has then also been translated into trust on a governmental level. Not a conspiracy, but just a fact of human nature, pleople prefer to deal with life's most important matters with other peple that they can depend on and trust. My suggestion is to do your homework before you delete, and continue to enjoy your T.N.E. club and leave proper history to the experts. I specialize in collegiate secret societies. Thank you""",0

  Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, Englisc by its speakers) is an early form of the English language that was spoken and written in parts of what are now  England and southern Scotland between the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century.
 

  Middle English is the name given by linguistics to the diverse forms of the English language spoken between the Norman invasion of 1066 and the mid-to-late 15th century.
 

  Early Modern English is the stage of the English language used from about the end of the Middle English period (the latter half of the 15th century) to 1650.
 

Being that this is my specialist (degree) subject and I am one of the few people who are actually able to read and speak Englisc (along with the old Frisian and Norse dialects which contributed to it), you are more than welcome to take me on about the reliability of those sources; but I don't fancy your chances )   09:15",0

"Outback / Drinking Urine ==

Once again, Bear teaches people how to get themselves killed.  As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst.  Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts.  The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine.  Your body is only about 1% salt.  Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine.  The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively.  Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either.  And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of.  And all of this assumes that it doesn't make you vomit outright and lose even more water.

To viewers of the show: don't do it!

"Marriage
The reference to a same-sex marriage was removed. Whilst I understand why, I think it is also important that the matter is made clear to anyone who is new to either author. The article does not make it clear that C J Cherryh is also female. I have therefore entered 'same-sex' to qualify the domestic partnership. 

Also, whilst marriage is legally,in some places, equally available to same-sex or hetreosexual couples, not everyone believes that in religious terms the two unions are equal. The view of those people also deserves to be respected as well as other views. I have therefore qualified the term 'marriage' with 'legal'.",0

 Angel 

Well, yeah I'm a bit miffed to be honest. It's okay. Buffy Season Eight is a barrel of godly goodness, and by comparison Angel feels like Amazons Attack. Characterizations are off, I'm afraid. Connor's introduction felt ... crappy. Wesley's been introduced in the wrong way - don't jump him into a new role and backtrack characterization, do a Giles where you see him maybe two panels at a time and flesh him out through his own internal monologue. Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided """"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!"""" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).

I'd say a good quality of the series is Betta George. I think 12 issues may be too long if this is the pace Lynch is going to have, and I'd have liked to see another writer try the Fight Night double-issue. I hate these publisher-exclusive contracts - I wish Geoff Johns or somebody could give it a go. I feel the book needs more pace, and better humour.

Mr. Haider, the theory that Pashtuns are an East Iranian people is the most scientific theory about Pashtun origin based on linguistic and anthropological studies/evidences contrary to other theories which are just wild speculations and fantastic fairy tales. So please, now that Pashtun ethnography has taken proper course, don't push it back to speculative histography by making irrational proclaimations that """"Pashtuns are an old race of its own"""" and that """"Pashtuns are great"""". This is an encyclopedia article and it should relect the dominent academic view about Pashtun origin instead of folkloric myths. 

Further, in detail every ethnic group has a distinct culture but on general level, different ethnic groups align with each other to form super groups with the same cultural, linguistic, and ethnic roots. There really was a proto-Iranian language, ethnicity, and culture. Anthropology, linguistics, and even social structure align Pashtuns with other Iranian people. This is a fact that cannot be refuted with mere sermises and conjectures.

I further inform the editors that Pashtun population in Karachi was 1.1 millions according to 1998 census of Pakistan. That might have swelled to at most 1.3-1.4 millions by now. I request the editors to exclude the statement like """"Pashtuns are twice the number of Pashtuns in Afghanistan"""" because, first proper population census of Afghanistan are yet to be held and second this statement would unnecessarily propogate the impression that """"Pashtuns are now well integrated in one state or the other"""".

 Disscussions with DMacks 

oth have understanding difficulty's.OneMadScientist (talk) 
I am talking about your behavior...we are all responsible for what we ourselves do, even if we feel provoked by others. It's a great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations. Your edits were explicitly written to insult a person rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions, and you even said you were trying to undo your previous steps towards repairing the destructive atmosphere here. That's all forbidden. Period. No """"but he said..."""" or """"I'm just proving I was right all along"""". What are your personal intents for being a Wikipedia editor? If it's to improve wikipedia articles, then go do so now and stop wasting everyone's time with discussions about your previous battles. If it is anything else, including trying to school others in morality or your sense of religious obligation, no...this website it not for you. DMacks (talk) 

@DMacks WELL - I'am talking about your, and Plasmic Physics's behavior and responsibility around here and maybe this website it not for you.
You Would Do well Take your own advice DMacks. Is there not a word for describing the lack of following one's own advice (rules) which I have been condemned for using. Oh, yes now I remember, It is (hypocrite).
And I was Beginning to think you had realized YOUR errors in regards to YOUR application of YOUR """"Obligations"""" as a Wikipedia """"morality code"""" enforcer and understood my very significant and valid arguments.
Specifically for now -
In regards to YOUR choice!!(and the actual definition) of what exactly constitutes a personal attack around here. And the objectivity by which it is applied and the selective abuse of its application by YOU in particular.
You are now bringing up the very important point that I would Have Very Much desired to take up with you in your absence.
I am sorry, I mistook your silence for understanding on your behalf.
I contend that you have failed miserably in the """"great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations"""" and should have known better given your display of """"apparent"""" authority.
I contend that (In This issue with Plasmic Physics - which you had been following from the start, at least) that after my initial """"transgressions"""" and subsequent overly profuse apologies, was being very polite and civil.
I was then was the subject of an Obvious personal attack from Plasmic Physics, who was my initial accuser!! in the very first instance (again NOT taking ones own advice!!).
His remarks which OBVIOUSLY """"were explicitly written to insult a person (me) rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions"""" and contained no factual justification.
My response contained words and statements that were correctly and appropriately describing (with civil English words) the FACTS in relation to nature of his personal attacks on me.
In my attempt to obtain an apology from him, while Lacking any support against his attack, you decided to label me the transgressor, but not him.
You appear to be very negligent and biased acting in your """"appointed role here???"""" to say the least, if not totally malicious.
I contend that your obviously biased behavior should preclude you from further involvement in any """"moral code violation"""" disciplinary action, let alone this specific one.
This is for starters in addressing your negative comments about me.
I hope I have I made this point clear to YOU now!  
OneMadScientist (talk) 
I would appreciate and DESERVE an apology from both of you but I can see that is unlikely. If not Please don't waste my time any longer with YOUR """"attempts"""" at trying justify either your or Plasma Physics transgressions toward me or bother me any longer about this issue and I SHALL LEAVE YOU ALONE and seek others here who deserve my considerate attention.

Someone in WP management needs to look at the Barbara Biggs entry, as it seems to my amateur eyes to be largely an advertizement of Biggs books, and a beat-up of her deeds and status based on what is written in same self-authored books. There are some references to media who interviewed her about her books/deeds but these again rested mostly on her own opinions about herself drawn from her self-authored books. Is there not supposed to be independant verification of her claims? 58.165.69.67

"The following policy is given in Wikipedia:Verifiability: ‘articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy’. On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’
The above enables me to derive some conclusions: 
What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’
Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material.
The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand. Again ‘The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ Let’s now focus on that.",0

[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from """"Chabenisky"""" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]

Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]

[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]

[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]

Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]

In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]

[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of """"World's Richest People"""", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the """"largest single e-commerce transaction"""", after he paid $40",0

"Hello ,

My name is Mrs. Rebecca Song, a Portuguese national .I have been diagnosed with Esophageal  cancer which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. 

As you read this, you do not have to feel sorry for me as it is a universal truth that we all must die someday. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just accumulating all the wealth in the world as I lay helplessly on my sick bed.

If I was given a second chance to live again, I'm sure I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it owing to what has befallen me now. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Seventy Five Million United States Dollars ($75, 000, 000.00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit in Europe.

That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race.

""" anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the Limerick article, they can add it in two seconds. Merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. Here it is a quick decision. Go for it. 
Dictionary it, or delete it?  
Merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge, no more and no less.  Moreover, you appear to have a broken sense of direction.  The notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}.  Both articles discuss the city of Limerick.  We don't have duplicate articles about the same thing here.  However, the reason that I suggested the merge, rather than outright did it, is that clearly the claim that Limerick is known as """"Stab City"""" for the reasons stated needs to be checked.  The article, like so many such articles, doesn't cite any sources.  With the notice, other editors will come to the discussion, and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say """"That's a load of old baloney!  Limerick isn't known as Stab City at all."""" and instead decide that rather than a merger, an outright deletion of Stab City for being unverifiable is called for.  Or, on the other hand, they may come up with some sources to cite.  Either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger.  
The merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. You could have posted a note on this talk page. Limerick is known as 'Stab City' (or used to be a few years ago anyway) but it is derogatory. There are seperate articles for city nicknames - see Big Apple. Googling '""""Stab City"""" -Limerick' turns up 1000 sites, including a US band. So Stab City could be perhaps a disambig.  
It wasn't a stub needing work.  It was, and is, a duplicate article, plain and simple.  Both articles are about the city.  I've pointed this out several times, now.  I've also pointed out that the parallel with Big Apple is a clearly false one.  
You haven't explained why it is 'clearly' false. The Big Apple is a nickname for New York and contains the history of the usage of that name. """"Stab City"""" is a nickname infrequently used to refer to Limerick in a derogatory way. The """"Stab City"""" article has almost no content, but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. I don't have the time or interest to do this.  Another example is Big Easy which redirects to New Orleans, or City of Light which redirects to Paris. If City of Light was an article containing one sentence: """"City of Light usually refers to Paris."""" would you put a merge note on Paris too?  
If it were as superficially bogus as """"stab city"""" was: Yes, of course.  This process is known as """"asking for the opinions of other editors"""".  It is a useful tool in some circumstances.  Notice that it works.  Two editors have already given different opinions here, and a third is forming an opinion.   
It is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. As you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus, and that we are now having a discussion about it, I have removed the merge notice.  
I've restored it.  The notice is there not just to get your attention alone, and I wrote """"as superficially bogus as 'stab city' was"""".  
Uncle G, How would you like to progress with this dispute?  
Uncle G has not replied for 5 days. I have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice.  
 The Stab City article is inaccurate in any case - the nickname dates back to well before the late 1990s and first arose after an incident in which an Argentinean tourist was stabbed.  I think this was in the mid 1980s.  I haven't edited the Stab City article as I'm undecided as to whether it's worth having.  
Merge it now - stab city is unfortunately associated with Limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it, but it certainly does not need a separate article.
 I agree, merge it now. I can't see a realistic prospect for Stab City to become a full article. I think there's a case for a Crime in Limerick article, but not for one on this piece",0

Saedon,

As you know, or at least should know, peer-review has become a very politicized process, not just for I.D., but for all non-mainstream scientific views. Casey Luskin has an excellent articleoutstanding article, heavily burrowed from a paper by physicist Frank Tipler, which details this, including direct quotes from multiple Nobel Prize winners on the deep flaws of the peer-review process. Even if the journal's referees, themselves, would be willing to publish pro-I.D. research, the fear of backlash  even boycotts  directed towards both themselves and their journals, surely prevents them from doing so.

You must understand, when dealing with intelligent design, we're dealing with something that causes nothing less than embarrassing, childish, outrageous, emotional outbursts from its detractors, including many scientists (the Bloggingheads incident comes to mind, where many scientists attempted to boycott Bloggingheads simply because they allowed Michael Behe on to discuss his views). These detractors, of course, include many Wikipedia contributors. I strongly suspect that includes you, which is I why you make such a suspect editor regarding this subject, and why none of my words, as reasonable as they may be, will have any effect on dogmatic thinking.

With all of this said, the Discovery Institute keeps a page archiving the many pro-I.D. articles which have been able to penetrate the politicized wall of orthodoxy that has sullied the peer-review process. The number is currently over 50, and continually growing.

Of course, once the objection that I.D. has no peer-reviewed publications in support of it has been met, the goalposts will be moved to the claim that, (a) they're not good enough, (b) there's not enough, or (c) a combination of a and b. Casey Luskin, again, has fantastic article, entitled """"Answering Objections about Discovery Institute's Peer-Review Page,"""" that addresses some of these goalpost shifts (this is the part where you ignore the arguments and attack Casey Luskin the person).

Let me also add that every paper which further unveils a level of sophistication in the cell, more design principles, function for something once thought to be junk, etc., weighs support to the notion that life was designed, and that the Darwinian view is based on ignorance. A couple of articles which come to mind are James A. Shapiro's Natural Genetic Engineering, which shows that evolution is the programmed result of the brilliantly designed technology located inside the cell, and Michael Sherman's Universal Genome theory, a view which demonstrates that evolution was a front-loaded event (read: evolution was programmed).""",0

I am a plastic surgeon and treat up to 8 gynecomastia patients a day from around the world.  I have been dealing with helping the public learn about this condition for now more than 30 years.

Dealing with so many gynecomastia patients, it is hard to express their frustration with the public just not understanding the problem.  The anger is intense and most cannot express themselves why they feel so stressed out about their problem.  I put a video of a particularly eloquent patient describing his living with gynecomastia up to help family and others understand the Emotion Behind Gynecomastia.  Unfortunately there is noting like hearing the stress in the human voice to emphasize the emotional component, it would have been nice to show the face, but then I would not have been permitted to share his experience.  I added it as a reference as I thought it was the best way to show that such details were available to those trying to deal with this problem.

Public phrases like those listed puffy nips also include """"bitch tits"""" but I did not know if that was permitted here.  So many just do not recognize gynecomastia but the lay phases added.

Non-surgical compression garments have been a major source of stress relief for those waiting  to see if their gynecomastia would resolve on its own, or were dealing with losing weight, or just could not afford surgery.  This link is to examples of how effective / not effective garments can be for real life sufferers of gynecomastia.  Fat people still look fat but the bouncing is stabilized.  Many have told me of the differences the garments have made their lives.  The parents of one 14 year old child from Trinidad told me he was a different person just from use of the garment while waiting the year his endocrinologist wanted for his medical condition to stabilize.  The actual surgery made a greater difference.

Gynecomastia comes in so many differnt forms that the limited pictures just does not tell the story well at all. The Gynecomastia Gallery link is a much more comprehensive method of demonstrating the problem.

Hope the additions were according to form.

Summary of proposed edit

Hello! I am a student at Drake University enrolled in a Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/Drake University/Global Youth Studies (Fall 2015):course that is striving toward taking out the systemic bias out of Wikipedia. My proposed edit is not extensive yet, but I am using my sources to explain the global side of popular music. It also explains how it is difficult to label something as popular music or not. I touched on the connection between world music and being labeled as an """"exotic other."""" I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres.

"""::Dearest Danny, I see you have not replied to any of the points put forward in my criticism of your obsessive use of propaganda, unfounded accusations, slander, and your ad hominem attacks to name but a few of your methods. I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is """"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body"""" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated, hypocrisy, slander and defamation of character, negative grossly subjective propaganda and multiple lies, all of which discredit your character, and your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are """"inaccurate"""", and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull. Give it up Danny; you are biting at your own air filled fantasies and straw men. Wishing you well, and I hope you come back down to reality soon. Kind regards Central.

""". If you want to talk about linguistic issues in the Spanish State, or about terrorist bands linked to nationalism, do so at their right articles. The way you try to shove those topics in an article about """"Nationalities in Spain"""""""" looks like you´re trying to inject your personal, unfavourable to those independentist movements POV in this article. Please stop doing that.  

My dear 81.202.96.146, please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that, for it is not your duty to tell me so. Give your opinion and defend it as you may, as I am doing, and put the full stop after it. Now, it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of """"those independentist movements"""". Sorry, I won't bother creating an article entitled """"Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism""""; but I do believe that if there's an article that deals with """"X nationalism"""" or """"Nationalities in Y"""", which includes """"X nationalism"""", it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups. To your accusation:

 I already assumed above that I was biased, as anyone else (my quote: """"Of course, this I'm saying is only part of the story; but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article."""").
 I haven't edited the article yet, because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion, no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me.
 Due to 1's """" as anyone else"""", your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation: you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article, thus unveiling your point of view... So, what's wrong about it?
 The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it. Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article.

I don't know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article; clearly not the article itself. My own are simply that, if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as """"nationalities in Spain"""" we'd better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told.

 

 Why can´t I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect? You are in fact, doing the same, by asking me not to do it. See the irony? I wasn´t issuing orders, just asking kindly for you to stop doing that. If you don´t want to, it´s ok.
By order:
1- Everyone is biased, that´s ok. But Wikipedia is not a soapbox. If you want to voice your personal concerns about """"spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia"""", that´s fine with me, but please don´t do it in an eclyclopedical article right? When we contribute to a wikipedia article, it´s not enough to go """"OK I´m biased because I think this and that, so let the battle begin"""". No, we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible. I´m not trying to point out my ideas in an article, as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually """"reach a middle ground"""" in the article´s content. No. I´m trying to be objective in this article, and you´re not, because you´re admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article.
2- That´s very respectful of you, and I think it´s the right thing to do.
3- No it doesn´t. I am not trying to push an agenda here. I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic they´re about. If I, for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had, in an article about Sabino Arana, you could rightfully accuse me of """"preventing obnoxious information"""" from getting into the article. But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities we´re talking about in this article, is just asking for something entirely reasonable. See the far away link between your proposed """"terrorist issue"""" stuff and the actual content of the article? As I said, create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain, and everything will be fine. By your same reasoning, anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism.
4- What did I state that was false? I made only one comment before this one, just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. Bye  

And I wonder... which are the sources for the map with that supposed ensemble of Nations, States, Confederations and Residents Associations",0

JayW - Predators do not scrutinize the internet in the hopes of tracking some kid who foolishly posted their name to Wikipedia. It simply doesn't happen. It doesn't happy here, nor does it happen anywhere else; and I would be happy to concede to anyone who proves otherwise, though I very much doubt that will happen. I whole-heartedly believe the situation this policy is designed to protect against is a terrible myth which, by distracting money, time and effort from actual issues, facilitates the sexual abuse of children.

On the other hand, some predators do use the chat services to anonymously groom children. This situation, while I doubt it would happen in such an incovenient environment, might deserve a policy.

..so, does this policy solve anything, as it stands? No - it doesn't prevent children from stating their age. Instead, it focuses on irrelevant information, like their street address and real name, which the predator can acquire privately once he has located the child's online contact information. Since many people use the same username across all the interwebs, this probably wouldn't be difficult.

The only solution, so far as I can see, is to police kids who mention their age. Any other policy is, to say the least, completely useless. Out,

Neutrality

The article seems to have veered towards being non-neutral. The following are of particular concern:

 The ridiculous amount of detail that the Japan Tobacco episode is given;
 Removal of references to Scruton's response—and defence—to the episode in The Guardian;
 Removal of a positive review (of Dooley's comment that Sexual Desire is """"magisterial"""") despite this having being discussed on this talk page;
 The extent of the coverage given to his views on homosexuality.

May, who had never been to America, invented a hero named Old Shatterhand, a white man who always won his battles with Native Americans, defeating his enemies through sheer will power and bravery. Young Hitler read and re-read every one of May's books about Old Shatterhand, totaling more than 70 novels. He continued to read them even as Führer. During the German attack on the Soviet Union he sometimes referred to the Russians as Redskins and ordered his officers to carry May's books about fighting Indians.

"Scarab bug tracking software 

Yesterday I was reading through Comparison of issue tracking systems and followed the link Scarab.

This lead to a disambiguation page. The page listed:
An open source bugtracker software

This text and the links contained are extremely confusing. The disambiguation template clearly states that if an internal link (such as the one from the comparison) leads to this disambiguation page, you should change that incoming link it to point to the appropriate article. Since the article did not exist and since the item in the list for the application was confusing, I decided to create a Scarab Bug Tracking page.

To make things as seamless as possible, I quickly copied the text from the old item into the new article, intending to improve the article as soon as it was created. Before I could make my modifications, you changed the content to link back to the list or something similarly stupid. (I would go back and read exactly what you changed it to, but you deleted the page, so I can’t check the history)

After I reverted your changes and then made some minor changes to the content, I put the page up for move proposal to Scarab (software) to be more consistent with pages that are from disambiguation pages.

This morning I came back to the page to check if it had moved, but it was gone! I assumed that maybe it was just moved and that the old page no longer existed. I poked around the Move proposal list, and the disambiguation page that I had originally edited (Still in that state) and could no longer find the page.

As a person unfamiliar with all Wikipedia bullshit politics and confusing processes, it took me a while to figure out exactly what happened to the page I had created less than 24 hours ago. Finally I found it, the person who originally ruined my short article after less than ONE MINUTE of my edit, - you -, deleted it!

In your comments, you did not explain the reason for deletion, you only sited “A3”. To anyone but a Wikipedia user extremely familiar with deletion, this would be meaningless. An “article too short” would have been much better. After digging around a lot, I found that it was a reference to the third reason an _A_rticle could be deleted. Hence, the A3. You should AT LEAST link to that so people that aren’t familiar with Wikipedia jargon can figure out what that means without searching through piles and piles of horribly disorganized Wikipedia-politics-ridden pages.

Considering that the content I posted stated that it was a stub, the time it takes to delete an article, and the relative ‘freshness’ of the page, it makes you look like a deleting troll. If you thought that the page was clearly grounds for deletion, you should have put that inside the article or something and let it stand for a good 48 hours before finalizing the deletion.

I agree that Wikipedia should not be laden with content-free articles, but having cyclic links from the disambiguation page, to the bug tracking software page, and back is worse. If there is no article to link to, there should be no link.

The only things that you achieved by deleting the page is: made yourself stand out as a stereotypical Wikipedia troll/nazi/zealot, put off a Wikipedia contributor from continuing to improve the quality of Wikipedia, wasted a lot of my time to investigate what the hell happened to the page I created, and broke at least two internal links.

You violated the spirit of Wikipedia and smashed what little hope I still had for the Wikipedia community. Congratulations, asshole.

PS: You can clean up the mess you created and the one that I was trying to clean up before.",0

 Dispute on user AI009 and articles on Potential Superpower & Superpowers 

I am starting this topic on user AI009, in the last several weeks I have seen and witnessed a lot of stirred conflicts but also a lot of misleading information by user AI009. User AI009 is making statements after statements (a 18 year old) about how Russia is not this and not that, a lot of hogwash and more trash is being stirred out by this anti Russian baloney. You can't say anything with this user hogging these articles without him, it is a constant cat dog game here. I am reading a lot of discussions and I have Googled """"AI009"""" , this guy thinks he is God here. The content is according to him, he is making his statements that I certaintly cannot understand why but I am seeing an anti Russian member here who is taking the positon to use this Superpower articles about who he thinks everything should be. Ok, I don't agree with this person and I think he should be banned where  should be in college studying instead of discriminating Russia or whatever message your trying to imput here because this is ridiculious people don't have a right to discuss anything here when user thinks he a cop above the law. I see other users also fustrated with user AI009 and I think this is turning into too much falsehood that no one can trust the content on Wikipedia on these issues. Oh know, whats the point here when we have an 18 year old kid who is making this his website.  Get off, do something else, write a book or something if you want to speak or say something anti Russian because you are doing what is not the best interest of anything here, you making this a cartoon not an information source and I don't like it.""",0

Yes this song mentions the famine but it isn't actually """"about"""" the famine, the media hype thing up to no end, even the name """"Famine song"""" was coined by the media not by Rangers or Celtic fans.

 I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading.  See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte:
 Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points.  In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points.  The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)
 The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area).  If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima.  Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller.  

 On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself.  98.218.195.90  12:41, 6 July 2010",0

The Wiki official policy on this, states in large bold letters: """"There is no excuse for personal attacks on other contributors. Do not make them.""""

 There is also a Wiki guideline that says that posting another person's personal information (e.g. legal name) almost always counts as Wikipedia:Harassment, an intimidatory behaviour that encourages an unpleasant atmosphere, and may deter other from posting or contributing for fear that they might be treated similarly, damaging Wiki.

I'm sorry, I don't understand.  What is the """"it"""" that doesn't make what clear?  The statement that you have kept deleting says that Trent reaffirmed (affirmed again) the then existing teaching that Christian marriage is a sacrament.  The statement does make that clear.  If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.  You'd also have to explain the significance you think you see in the fact that in this respect marriage is in no way different from the other sacraments, none of which was or could be recognized as a sacrament until a theology of sacraments was developed.  Isn't that obvious?
As for the latest edit, which said that the Council of Trent reaffirmed the existing teaching only """"from their perspective"""", that is an utterly silly, unsourced, imaginative addition that contrasts with the clear decisive statement of the Fathers of the Council, who certainly wouldn't have dreamt of adding phrases such as """"from our perspective"""" to their clear reaffirmation of the existing teaching!

"""Hi again. I do have this in the back of my mind and am aware of it. Apologies for being slow getting back to you.

It's a really hot day here in the UK after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think you're talking about Category:Beverage companies, and how breweries end up there. At some point that has been organised thus - Category:Beverage companies - Category:Alcoholic beverage companies - Category:Beer and breweries by region - Category:Beer and breweries in North America - Category:Beer and breweries in the United States - Category:Beer and breweries in Alabama. The brewing companies are contained within each """"Beer and breweries in Foo"""" cat. What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article. 

Would you ping me when you respond, otherwise this might drift a bit. '''''' *YES!

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"massacre"""" and """"execution"""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.

Your request for rollback

Hi Jeffrd10.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!   """,0

Avoid Greatest Story like the plague!! Read the reviews ! I consider Max Van Sydow to be a very respectable actor but it's almost like they sedated him, took his soul and left him with one expression, he's like a zombie as Jesus. The film had me yawning all the way through and I genuinely had to check myself several times from shutting off for a kip! Never a bright moment, nothing to lift the mood, even the silly cameos in it. It's not that the film, the scenery or whatever is bog standard or dreadful, but its the way the scene are compiled and the lifelessness of the actors in it which make it exceedingly dull and uninspiring to watch. David Lean was apparently an uncredited assistant director on it which I find hard to believe. Uncredited perhaps because of sheer embarrassment with the result. I'm not sure how anything in which Lean so much as touched ended up that dull... I just saw Treasure Island (1972 film). Welles was perfect casting as Long John!

Lone boatman, it is you who have willfully and repeatedly violated Wikipedia's policies by making entire changes to the 'eternity clause' article then threatening me as usual.

___________________________

JanetteDoe, You are right that the referenced article in National Review is about not changing the fundamental principles of democracy, not a """"constitution"""". And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman and the three other """"editors"""" who suddenly showed up for the first timee and agreed with Lone boatman. Lone boatman does not want the word """"democracy"""". After I accused him of synthesizing he then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. This page was part of the German law page specific to Germany, not an international one which is already covered under a Wikipedia article entitled """"entrenched clause"""". Lone boatman added the additional international data at the top of the page only to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constitution"""" at the top of his change. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" to pursue his use of the word """"constitution"""" (which I had previously told him Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change to make it appear that he is not politically motivated with his changes. Then several editors suddently showed up for the first time and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in at the top. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which the article was. And it was not a personal essay on a statute, as I have been accused of. It is an important historic prohibition placed in the Germany's Basic Law regarding the protection of Germany's new democracy.  """,0

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.

I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway.

He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...

Mick I think knows this subject more than I do, although I am more or less one of the major (at least frequent, anyway) editors relating to religion and Christianity. Also, in some of his statements, like his accepting the """"Apocalypse of John,"""" is is clear that he definitely qualifies as """"former"""". There are also a variety of Jewish Christian groups, although there is no evidence Dylan belonged to a group that has been described as such. This subject has been extensively discussed before, and in fact led to an editor being banned at one point. He did achieve a great deal of press coverage, and thus notability, for the albums he issued during his """"Christian"""" period, and it is seems on that basis that his """"Christianity"""" be noted. As he has never conclusively subsequently officially renounced any form of Christianity, there is a good chance WP:BLP might enter into our moving him into Category:Former Christians or anything like that, because he has never himself that I know of described himself unequivocally in such terms. In short, this is still a matter of some ambiguity about the subject, particularly taking BLP into account, and I think the current categorization schema was arrived at after those really lengthy, and frankly extremely contentious, discussions. And we really don't have a category of Category:People who have been described as both Jewish and Christian, so this seems to be, basically, the only way to go. Some sort of FAQ template at the top of the page might be useful here, but, in general, I think Mick is among the most productive editors on this article, and I trust his conclusions based on the amount of material he has personally reviewed and his conclusions.

"Sails as wings? 

I think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter, as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction (relevant to the wind direction) that one wishs to go.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.

In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.

Lift (force)

Anyway, hope this helps.

 Vincent Lefèvre Crap 

He insistently replaces simple illustration (it was asked above), which says that floating the point is equivalent to choosing scale (micro- vs. kilo- vs. giga-), which you do every day, with opposite statement """"floating point allows to measure both astronomical and atomic scales using single measurement unit"""". You do not measure galactic distances with millimetres. Vincent Lefèvre is idiot. He also eliminates further illustration which reminded that scale selection corresponds to discarding least significant bits and ten-bit exponent can denote discarding of hundreds of bits of """"single unit of measurement"""" (when you pass from mm to light years you discard hundreds of least significant digits in fact and, thus, pass, to a different unit), which is real idea behind introducing the floating point (exponent), disliked by Vincent Lefèvre. It is difficult to say what Vincent had in mind in his """"clarification"""" edit. I cannot find any sense in it. Did he just wanted to repeat the that trivial idea that fp enables huge range one more time?

 Agnew early career 

I'm a bit loath to edit the Agnew article when you and TRM are making such as good job of putting it into some order.

The promising Leicestershire fast bowler, Jonathan Agnew, aged 22 [sic], is being flown home from Australia after contracting glandular fever. He was to have spent the winter playing for a club side.
Mike Turner, the Leicestershire secretary-manager, said: """"It's a great disappointment because Jonathan had just returned to his best form after battling for 12 months to recover from a back injury.""""

Unless you're a newly hatched pod person, you already know that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is not only truculent but is addicted to being truculent. But let me add that when Positive and Negative Merger Foundation promotes the idea of a """"global village"""" it secretly means """"global pillage"""". What follows is a set of observations I have made about condescending jokers. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's idolators have already started to rob, steal, cheat, and murder. The result: absolute vapidity, shallow and postmodernist cacophony, lack of personality, monotony, and boredom. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation likes scare tactics that bar people from partaking in activities that cannot be monitored and controlled. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that I have to wonder where it got the idea that it is my view that """"metanarratives"""" are the root of tyranny, lawlessness, overpopulation, racial hatred, world hunger, disease, and rank stupidity. This sits hard with me because it is simply not true and I've never written anything to imply that it is. 
If some people are offended by my mentioning that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's vicegerents believe a conspiracy of purblind spoilsports control banking, foreign policy, and the media, then so be it. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's asseverations are in every respect consistent with the school of huffy thought that tends to dilute the nation's sense of common purpose and shared sacrifice. When I state that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is a faithful student of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese strategist who advocated demoralizing one's enemy as the highest art of warfare, I'm merely trying to deal with the relevant facts. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's true goal is to palm off our present situation as the compelling ground for worldwide deconstructionism. All the statements that its operatives make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics; they do nothing to build bridges where in the past all that existed were moats and drawbridges. 
Despite what you may have been taught in school, I welcome Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's comments. However, Positive and Negative Merger Foundation needs to realize that we must undeniably raise a stink about Positive and Negative Merger Foundation and its insipid perversions. Does that sound extremist? Is it too brainless for you? I'm sorry if it seems that way but that's life. Given Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's record of shady dealings, we can say that its squibs are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of commercialism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up.

There seems to be some general confusion about the pronunciation of the Roosevelts' name, even within the FDR article.  I've tried to find a few reliable sources for this info.

M-W gives:
Main Entry:
    Roo·se·velt
Pronunciation:
    \ˈrō-zə-vəlt (Roosevelts' usual pron.), -ˌvelt also ˈrü-\
Dictionary.com gives:
Roo·se·velt  /ˈroʊzəˌvɛlt, -vəlt, ˈroʊzvɛlt, -vəlt; spelling pron. ˈruzəˌvɛlt/
Inogolo gives this about Teddy's name:
Name: Roosevelt  Phonetic Pronunciation: ROAZ-uh-velt
Notes: There has been much debate about the correct pronunciation of Roosevelt's last name, however, in several letters Theodore Roosevelt himself specifies the correct pronunciation. In a letter to the Rev. William W. Moir dated October 10, 1898 he writes:
As for my name, it is pronounced as if it was spelled """"Rosavelt."""" That is in three syllables. The first syllable as if it was """"Rose.""""
Note that none of these sources make a distinction between Teddy and FDR, despite the claims of some that they preferred different pronunciations.  At the very least, each article should be internally consistent.  For Teddy, it seems to be clear that it's /ˈɹoʊzəvɛlt/.  His statement above makes that pretty clear.  FDR's case doesn't seem to be as unequivocal, but the same pronunciation seems to be the preferred one in most media.  The most common variant seems to be the barely noticeably different /ˈɹoʊzəvəlt/.  Most seem to cite the preferred pronunciation of the name being three syllables, not two.

Anma seriously you really have some issues that need to be addressed. Although I have spoken to other editors, they have been professional and helpful whereas you have been incredibly insulting, plus your behavior is considered harassment (even if Wikipedia defines it differently, I know and trained in these matters and this does qualify, and at the end of the day that will overrule any website). Somehow you always seem to be on top of things should a change be made on the YCDTOTV page. Which leads me to think you are indeed watching the page, and you are probably the original author and a huge fan of the show, and you don't like the idea of someone else coming in and editing or adding on to your work. I'm sorry but you are behaving like a bully. You're right my comment was not a threat, but it is a warning not necessarily for Wikipedia but for the real world. At some point someone will put their foot down and say enough is enough this behavior is inappropriate and there will be consequences. You can't act like this it is called a power trip. Also think about it for a second if you look at our past disputes it normally is because I have made multiple changes on multiple pages, so maybe the Amyas """"update"""" was just a small snafu as I did not touch anything else.

 Copyright violations 

Lightbringer, if you restore these copyright violations again, I will block you.   

Freemasonrywatch.ORG is quite clearly NOT a commercial content provider, but a personal webpage/blog, therefore your justification is completely bogus. In fact because you knowingly provided a false justification for deletion merits you being removed from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator, in addition to the previous complaint I made against you about your anti-catholic hate filled username. 

 The Epopt provides this explanation for the meaning of
 hisuserame: -Mason Boyne, Presbyterian bigot and Orange
 Lodgemember, says to his wife, “Did you know, Morag, that
 if you spell ‘Pope’ backwards you get ‘Epop,’ which is a
 four-letter word beginning with ‘E’ like ‘Evil’? You see,
 it's all there in the Bible if you just shoogle the letters
 around a bit.”

The fact that you continue to harrass and interject yourself in a complaint and arbitration between pro-occult and anti-occult editors shows your complete disregard for Wikipedia guidelines, and is further proof you should be permanently revoked from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator.   

 

 

 Letters on the Masonic Institution 

By President John Quincy Adams 

Originally Published: 
1847 T. R. Marvin 
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 

PREFACE 

IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion, of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons. The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made, had the effect, at least for a time, if not permanently, to check the farther spread of that association. The legislative power of some of the States was invoked, and at last actually interposed, to prevent the administration of extra-judicial oaths, including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order. This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached. It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order, or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system. From the moment of the adoption of a penal law, deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of, the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside. At this day, the subject has ceased to be talked of. The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things, until at last it may be said, that few persons are aware of the fact, provided it be not especially forced upon their notice, that not only Freemasonry continues to exist, but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature, if not of its unjustifiable obligations, not merely live, but greatly flourish in the midst of them. 

Fully aware of this state of things, a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated, yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations. Without cherishing the remotest desire, even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation, of reviving an old excitement, they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape, some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties, as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemason's Oath. Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams. But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written, and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion, they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination. This great deficiency, it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to, a desirable object to supply. They accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume, not as a matter of sale, but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution. And first of all, they deemed",0

 Someone keeps erasing this with no comment to me...very unethical.

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President of the United stat",0

Simon Baron-Cohen image

Very kindly provided by Simon Baron-Cohen, who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. It is Non-free but with permission for fair use.

Image can be resized, moved, cropped and upload as second image (with same permissions) whatever, but thought I'd better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan.  

 It's not an orphan, since Simon Baron-Cohen points at it. I'd really rather not have this image in Asperger syndrome, for reasons already discussed. This article already highlights SBC's theories too much, at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable; including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already.  

He actually gave it for this article, so let's try and see what the consensus is? There is no reason why you shouldn't get images of other """"eminent contemporary researchers"""" as well to balance?  
Other editors, such as SandyGeorge, have complained about a lack of images in this article. Delete this one and there is only one small image of Asperger. Zeraeph is right, get more images to balance it, don't just delete.  

Getting more images of other eminent researchers would """"balance"""" the article only in that it would be better to have images of Ehlers, Frith, Gillberg, Happé, Klin, Ozonoff, Rogers, Volkmar, Wing, etc., than having just Baron-Cohen. But this would be changing the article in the wrong direction (not to mention being a source of further disputes). Asperger syndrome should focus on AS, not on AS researchers. With the exception of Asperger himself and maybe Wing, who were instrumental in the history of the disorder, the other researchers just don't make the cut. Rather than head in this direction, the article would be better off stealing the images from Autism. If you take a look at the images in Autism, all but one are far more relevant to AS than this image of Baron-Cohen is.  

I agree with Eubulides. SBC is already over-represented, and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. Maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a 'who's who gallery' of AS researchers (for those attached to this idea).  

I agree with Eubulides and Soulgany101.  Yes, we need images, and there are images that could be used to illustrate AS; SBC isn't one of them, and gives undue weight to one researcher's views.  His image should be used in his article, where anyone curious about him can find it (but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off).   (Talk) 01:""",0

"""== Spyros Sofos ==

I'm not sure if you are Spyros Sofos or just a fan of his but Wikipedia is not a blog to promote the personal political views of Mr. Sofos and/or his associates.  I say this because your posting history here seems to reflect a cheerleading mentality towards Mr. Sofos rather than accepting that everyone can also be criticized for their views.

A couple of myths you believe that I'd like to clear up.

a. Spyros Sofos makes it clear that he does not see himself related to ancient Greeks in his works. Despite confusion over using similar nomenclature this effectively means his use of the word """"Greek"""" is of non-ethnic Greek context. Mr. Sofos see's national/ethnic identities as """"imagined communities"""".  (and not only Greeks  he deconstructs Turkish identity as well). While he is allowed to have a philosophical point of view, he can't have his proverbial cake and eat it too. He's a Greek citizen but not an ethnic Greek.

b. Spyros Sofos is certainly criticized by the far right in Greece but this point obfuscates its not just the far right that criticizes him. For instance, Mr. Sofos uses the word """"Macedonia"""" to describe the former Yugoslav republic is criticized by Greeks of all political persuasions (including both moderate left and right parties). His  narration of history is also criticized by Greeks of all political affiliations for casually dismissing Greek themes present since antiquity.

OK, I'll list here what you flagged. Some are not mine. I'll comment later and see if others have individual opinion first.   
Since then similar efforts have been organized for other 2008 presidential candidates.[citation needed]
Sample comment: This seems to be a fine summary statement, reliably sourced in the article such as by UPI. We can just copy the footnote refs to it.   
The popular usage of """"moneybomb"""" to describe a coordinated mass donation drive for a political candidate can be traced to a weekly donation drive, the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which aimed to raise $1 million each week for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.[2][citation needed] (Daily Paul)
Jesse Elder, a New York City jazz pianist,[3][4] registered the new identity """"RonPaulMoneyBomb"""" at YouTube;[5][citation needed] (New York Times, All About Jazz, YouTube)
Eric Nordstrom then registered the identical .com domain.[6][citation needed] (Network Solutions)
Supporters of Mike Huckabee organized a moneybomb on November 20 to commemorate International Children's Day, which raised nearly $225,000, well over the pledged amount, bringing Huckabee's monthly total to $1 million as of November 20th.[11][citation needed] (Nov20ForTheChildren)
Supporters of Dennis Kucinich's presidential campaign are also using the term """"moneybomb"""" to describe their own major fundraising drive aimed for December 15, 2007, the anniversary of the Bill of Rights coming into effect.[12][citation needed] (News and Policy)
Proposed on November 6 on Daily Kos, the drive has an ultimate goal for 100,000 pledges of $100.[13][citation needed] (December152007)
Kucinich supporters are using viral advertising techniques to promote the drive by putting up YouTube videos and circulating them throughout the web.[citation needed]
Along with generating a significant amount of donations for a political candidate, a moneybomb can also generate significant media interest in a largely unknown candidate.[citation needed]
In addition to the media coverage, the November 5 drive was able to get 21,000 new donors to the campaign, over half of the donors on that day.[18][citation needed] (AP)
While there is no definitive link, after November 5, Ron Paul saw a measurable rise in the polls, showing the potential ability for a moneybomb to improve a candidate's place in a political campaign.[20][21][citation needed] (TransWorldNews, NBC4)""",0

 Flagship is singular 

Many states have two (or more) excellent state universities; often, one may exceed the other on one or another measure of excellence.  But a state with two excellent universities has that - not two flagships.  """"Flagship"""" is a singular term - a good reference for the word generally can be found here.  In this context, """"flagship"""" means, as the introduction says, """"the leading comprehensive public research university in a given U.S. state"""".  (The only sort of exception that makes sense in this context is a system like New York's, where the state university system resembles a system of franchises more than anything else.)  With this in mind I've edited the list to remove some schools that are plainly not a state's """"flagship"""".  I left a state's entry alone if I wasn't sure, and so some double-entries do remain; someone who knows those schools better should fix those.

And you started to buulshit that that money was """"for building and strenghten the fortresses/defences"""", going so far in your bullshit that for the following war (AD 105) you, as roman empire fan and as such automatically history falsifier), as reason for this roman attack/war on Dacia, you mentioned again the invading romans as """"the good guys""""😉, and the dacians as """"the bad, cut trouths, robbers, dacians""""😉, which were """"justfull punished by the romans"""" in this """"punitive"""" war against the dacians IN DACIA, because """"the dacians used the money received from the romans after the last war and used ut for.. building and strenghten the fortresses/defences""""(!), so for exactly what they were suppose to use it, according to your own afirmations!! Duuh! 

So the roman empire did not invade other countries to demand """"protection money"""" (tribute) from them to not invade them again(tipical italian culture/maffia), but they invaded the world TO PAY anual tribute to those countries??

I do not know what medication do you use, but you obviously forgot to take it for a long time.

Well, you are a roman or a roman fan, so it's understanable that you have no clue what so ever what are you talking about. You are focussing on 1 thing only: Praising the cut throuts romans and presenting them as """"the best and most civilised people in the World"""", which invaded, masacred, robbed and enslaved countless nations and civilisations, because... """"they were the good guys, period""""😉.

Also enjoying throwing women and children (plus everybody actually) alive to wilde beasts to eat them alive in the arena (Damnatio Ad Bestias), was another obvious sign of the """"roman civilisation""""😉 which you admire so much, and which thus also says much about you, who and what you are.

Your attacks on Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets are considered vandalism.

"I'm still awaiting an explanation as to why my careful and accurate sourcing of statements in this article was vandalized while I was away during the past three weeks.  When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.  For example, re the Brincknell incident, Alan deliberately conflates William Waters, one of the jurors in the coroner's inquest into the death of Thomas Brincknell, and Oxford's servant, William Walter.  On p. 48, Alan writes of the coroner's inquest that:

>The 17 jurymen were, however, as compliant as the jury was packed: one juryman, William Waters, was Oxford's own servant.<

Alan clearly knew this statement to be false since he himself transcribed the testimony of Oxford's servant, William Walter, in a 1599 lawsuit in which William Walter described himself as being 50 years of age on 8 May 1599.  See Alan's transcript at:

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/RUSWEL/ruswel07.html

Oxford's servant, William Walter, was thus almost the same age as the 17-year-old Oxford at the time of Thomas Brincknell's death, and could not possibly have served on a jury at that age.  The juryman William Waters was obviously an entirely different person from Oxford's servant, William Walter.  Because he did not like the jury's finding that the death was the result of Brincknell's own actions, Alan deliberately made a false statement about one of the jurors to impugn the jury's finding.  This is merely one among dozens of examples I could cite which demonstrate that no 'fact' stated in Alan's book can be accepted without checking it against archival documents. Nina Green",0

"""Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.

First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)
Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  """"No-boo"""" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.
If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called """"The No-boo Affair"""", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is """"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did"""", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a """"clear falsification"""", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term """"no-boo"""" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.
Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this """"No-boo Affair"""" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.

It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — 18:08, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)""",0

 Bhojpuri language 

Bhojpuri language is more similar to Awadhi, Braj and Hindi than Magahi or Maithili. And actually i'm unable to provide any citation due to lack of proper categorisation and consideration by authorities and so there's no published record. But if you want, i can prove my point.. Better let me do.
For example, if i've to say, """"What is you name?"""" in bhojpuri, it'd be, """"tahaar naam kaa ha?"""" in awadhi, it is, """"tahaar naam kaa hai?"""" in hindi, it is, """"tumhara naam kya hai?"""" in braj, it is, """"tahaar naam kaa hai"""", and in magadhi, it is """"tor naam ki helthi?"""" in maithili, it'd be, """"aahank naam ki chhe?"""". Now decision is all upon you.
And one thing, if there's no evidence on a particular point on net then the view of native speaker can be, should be and must be accepted.

 Official song title: The official title of the song is リンガ・フランカ ! Only this Japanese title exists! Proof are the official tracklist by the label Universal Music Japan  and the official press release of the entertainment company SM.

 Translations: Translations of song titles should be real translations! Official dictionaries should be used to get correct translations. In the case of リンガ・フランカ the official English translation is """"lingua franca"""".

"In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”
 
Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same. If we leave this lie as it is, it will certainly give a bad influence to the US-Japan relation.”",0

"Thats simply not true. The following from Appleman:

The large numbers of Korean refugees crowding the Yongdong area undoubtedly helped the enemy infiltrate the 1st Cavalry Division positions. On 24 July, for example, a man dressed in white carrying a heavy pack, and accompanied by a woman appearing to be pregnant, came under suspicion. The couple was searched and the woman's assumed pregnancy proved to be a small radio hidden under her clothes. She used this radio for reporting American positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes.

In the meantime, and pursuant to General Walker's order on the 11th, Colonel Murch's 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry, had been engaged in helping to clear the enemy from the area south of Yongsan. On the 11th Murch's battalion departed from its assembly area near Masan and rolled north toward the Naktong River. A steady stream of Korean refugees clogged the road. As the battalion pushed its way through this traffic a refugee cart overturned, exposing about fifteen rifles and several bags of ammunition. Approximately twelve North Korean soldiers disguised as refugees accompanying it fled across an open field.

 Had you bothered to look at the references provided, you would see the sentence on Taejon is cited to Sloan, not Appleman. From Sloan:

but now hundreds of enemy infiltrators, many clad in white to mingle undetected with civilian refugees who moved freely among the American troops, were all around the men of the 34th. There was no safe haven from snipers firing rifles and tossing grenades from scores of buildings, and soon after daylight, NKPA tanks rumbled into the city.

 This is especially important considering that Mucio used the defeat at Taejon and the Nork use of refugee infiltrators as factor in his decision.  

 I have also found dozens of accounts from June-August 1950 in the papers speaking of Nork troops using refugees to mask their movements. If you continue to strip the article of this crucial context, I will put every singe account I can find in the article. I believe what we have here is an adequate summary of the tactics the Norks uses which drove the US policy on refugees.",0
"""No, but the article states that a """"ground attack"""" version of an F-16 was cancled.  The reference clearly refers to a """"close air support"""" version of the F-16 and not a """"ground attack version"""", and I changed the article to reflect as such.  The irony is, even though this close air support version was cancled, the F-16 has engaged in close air support (CAS) in every major conflict (for the U.S.) it has flown in, up to and including present day operations in Iraq.  Your definition of ground attack is skewed.  Ground attack can be many things, including CAS, but also things such as interdiction, where high speed can be very much an advantage for a ground attack aircraft, to help avoid defenses.

I don't understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading. The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the women's groups in India maintain. The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it. The rushed through new anti-rape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma. Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test (it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure) and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal. I accept the Cabinet are making positive noises about it though they are unlikely to accept any of Justice Verma's proposals or adopt the spirit of his reforms ie demanding equal respect for women from low castes tribals and minority indian communities. i am adding four tildas now but I presume that's wrong desmond coutinho,0

If you're interested, I encourage you to take a look at the Online Ambassador guidelines; the """"mentorship process"""" describes roughly what will be expected of mentors in the coming term.  If that's something you want to do, please apply!

You can find instructions for applying at WP:ONLINE.

The person on the page you are citing is giving a fictional review of an album.  Jeff is still David's manager.

 revision to chart 

I know it can be written that he was safe every week but go around to all the AI contenstant charts and you see the result of every week in the chart.   
Yea and they all should be changed. Just as we don't beat the obvious into people we don't need to state ___ has again gone another week. The info of what order they sang is also unhelpful. The lede clearly states he finished as the runner-up and we can give credit to our readers that they will realize that he didn't just sing those songs as a special guest. I'm not going to delete on all those other AI articles but I believe that should happen.   Banjeboi 
 So you think if someone wants to know if a contestant was safe they can go the American Idol season page?   
The chart is a supplement to the text which should be clear. The lede should state as of April 2009 ____ is a contestant. And when eliminated it states that info. Likewise with bottom three info, if it's relevant it will be in a reliable source - and OMG every bit of this stuff is covered - so we then cover it. _____ has never been in the bottom three or ____ has been in the bootom three twice before elimiation, etc. The order they sang? That seems likes it's original research or, sorry to say, fancruft, but not helpful on the biography articles. We have no reliable sourcing that the order impacts anything although it might.

 Pozdrav 

Pozdrav Direktore, ovo je tekst koji sam stavio odmah iza tvog odgovora na diskusionoj strani od clanka """"Differences between standard Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian language"""". Pozdrav tebi i sve najbolje:
Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this, that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion to Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.
Best Regards to you Direktor and to your beautiful and cosmopolitan Split and Dalmatia. Best Cheerful Greetings;""",0

 """"mass movement of Turks into central Anatolia"""" is an unsourced statement from a Wiki article, so I am not sure if it's worth discussing (the article I cited above disputes that). If there was a massive wave of newcomers there should be genetic evidence. Also considering the Byzantine Empire of the Comnens (12th century) covered about half of Anatolia, I doubt """"the biggest areal [Turkish] language spread happened from 11th to 14th in the Anatolian area"""". 

I don't think """"critical mass"""" is a meaningful concept here. As Don Ringe put it: """"History shows that comparatively small groups of immigrants can induce their new neighbors to adopt their language — gradually over several generations, of course — if (1) they have enough economic or political power, and (2) they can offer some important advantage to those who are willing to adopt their language.""""

"This is the armeniapedia version about the battle

In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  

First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article. Does anybody watch in Armenia what is going on here?",0

No contention, I think it is a good thing, and I am wondering how to do it where the election data is owned by the election article or a template.  The bad thing is to have several copies of the data- one in each candidate article- floating around.

One way is to have,

Electoral results
 {{Election X}}
 Template:Election Y (this has data)
 Page:Election Y

If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English.

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released 

- Soccer Battle 2

- American Idiot
- The Prisoner
- Hero Movie
- THE FIGHT OF A LIFETIME ! ! ! ! !
- Ryan V.S Marco

- The Amazing Jog of 2008
- Detective Movie
- Camp Rock
- How to be a bro !
- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel

Peter the Hermit and Emerich's respective endeavours really have nothing to do with the actual First Crusade that was led by Godfrey, Raymond and Bohemond.

"""
Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

Now, the robot Terminators in T3 are T1's and Kristana Loken is the TX.  I hope that clears it up...""""  While the term """"T-850"""" is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.  Rich

Zeus freeing the Cyclopes from Hades. That being said you also told me you read Theoi. So do I. I have read everything on Theoi. It's source of information. My question is how to you edit information. Do you copy off of other Wikipedia pages. I ask this because I read false information on Wikipedia before. Most of the time information is correct but I have seen. False information put on there before. Which is why I never trust what I read on Wikipedia. It's good I can Talk to you. To get to know you a little better. I would like to know do you use published sources. Do you read a lot of greek mythology books. Where does your knowlege come from. I'm trying to make sure that you didnt just copy what you put in. off another Wikipedia article. Or a website that copy's off of Wikipedia. Any information will help me out. I am a greek mythology nut case. I like the greek god Hades a lot. Which is why I am asking this question. The reason why I got concerned about the whole topic. Was I read what look like the source on the Cyclopes page. After I read the play it was not anywhere on there. I later found out that I mis understood what. Gold Dragon said. I got mad about it. Because I dont trust Wikipedia. Right now Wikipedia is the only source I can find that says. Zeus returned the Cyclopes from Hades. After their death. So what I am asking is what kind of sources do you use on everything. I hope dont just repeat stuff from unreilable sources. Do you use published sources. One's that can be trusted.

 Origin of the theory of Liszt's """"piano revolution"""" 

The theory of Liszt's revolutionising piano playing was apparently an invention of Lina Ramann. She had in November 1876 asked Liszt whether his """"Umwälzung der Klaviertechnik"""" (""""Revolution of piano technique"""") had been due to Paganini's Caprices. on December 1 Liszt wrote to this that it was his biographer who had to decide, since he himself was unable to take an objective point of view towards his foolish own productions. It was his only consolation that they could have become even worse after all.

Lina Ramann's """"decision"""" can be found in her Franz Liszt als Künstler und Mensch, Erster Band, Zweites Buch, p.106. According to this, Liszt's hands had been rather small and could hardly stretch a 9th. From Paganini's Caprices, according to Ramann, Liszt took the idea how to play wider intervals, and this was his entire """"revolution"""". Ramann's theory is of course wrong. There were others who wrote wide intervals as well (for example Schumann, Chopin, Henselt, Thalberg, Döhler, Dreyschock and many further ones). To this comes that the theme of Liszt's Clochette-Fantasy was not taken from Paganini's Caprices, but from a violin concerto, and that there are no extraordinarily wide intervals in this particular piece. It is to be presumed that Liszt himself read Ramann's theory with astonishment.85.22.19.160  """,0

Other hazards of heliskiing include falling into very deep tree wells, """"snow mushrooms"""" dropping from trees, suffocation after falls in very deep powder (rare), crevasses on glaciers, common mountain terrain features such as cliffs and creek beds, and  obviously  typical ski-related injuries.

I have a lot of sympathies for Mergism, but in this case, it's a bit tricky. A Structurist solution might be better here. I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with """"Main article: ..."""" just under the heading of each section. What I don't like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.

Although the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, """"preimage of the neutral element"""" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the """"General Case"""" section. (The """"Mal'cev algebra"""" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. 

Null space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.

Hmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.

IntroductionSecond Paragraph
The source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written.  The article makes legal distinction between CFS BC and CFS national.  It doesn't support a broad assertion that as you say """"The CFS generally referred to legally consists of 3 separate organizations, the national CFS, a provincial chapter and CFS-Services which are often collectively referred to as CFS""""

Also: """"The organizations generally brand themselves as CFS and do not make the distinction between the branches.""""
Your source does not support that statement. Also """"brand"""" is a corporate term and not NPOV language.

Also: """"In addition, it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the CFS de-facto one organization"""" Is not supported by the one source you provided.

See the reliable sources policy: """"Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made;"""" - WP:RELY

Simon Fraser's The Peak, has a well established and long time editorial bias against CFS so I'm not sure if the article you use is even considered a reliable source.  Again check WP:RELY for all the details

 Template:Infobox Network 

Hi. I've restored your version of the code for the template header, so that it appears within the infoboxas is standardrather than above it. This, and adding a couple optional info lines, has brought me to the limits of my coding ability. Request: Is it possible to further modify the code, so an editor has the option of employing the infobox without using a header at all? (See, for example, the use of Infobox Biography in Henry Cowell.) When I attempt this with Infobox Network (that is, either erasing the """"name"""" line or leaving it blank, under any of the recent iterations of the header code), it leaves a little rogue vertical mark in the linespace above the logo image, insteading of eliminating the linespace altogether.

"Here once again is the Wiki position on primary sources:

Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.

Do you believe that the primary sources have been reliably published? If so, they may be used in Wikipedia?
Do you believe that I have interpreted the primary source or misrepresented what that source says in a summary? If so, can you supply an example?
Are you able to verify the accuracy of the contents of each of the cells?
Do you believe that there is any actual interpretation in the table? If so where?",0

More interesting things.  According to pollster.com, the Senate Breakdown (remember, only about 1/3 of seats are up for election every year) should be:

Democrats: 54
Republicans: 41
Independents (both of whom sit with the Democratic caucus): 2
Undecided: 3 (but all are in traditionally strong Democratic states, so they'll probably fall into the Democratic column).

Interestingly, both Obama and Biden will need to be replaced in the Senate.  Usually, the Governor of the state in which those seats are held choose the replacement until the next election (again usually).  Obama is from Illinois, the governor is a Democrat, so will be replaced by a Democrat.  Biden is from Delaware, one of the most solidly Democratic states, and the Democratic candidate for governor is leading by a huge margin, so expect a Democratic replacement there.

According to pollster.com, the House of Representatives should fall as follows:

Democrats:  240
Republicans: 179
Undecided:  16

Here's an extract from Speigel: """"Copts make up the largest Christian community in the Arab world and around 8 million Egyptians belong to the Coptic Church. They're barred from high government positions, diplomatic service and the military, as well as from many state benefits. Universities have quotas for Coptic students considerably lower than their actual percentage within the population.Building new churches isn't allowed, and the old ones are falling into disrepair thanks to a lack both of money and authorization to renovate. When girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted, the police don't intervene. Thousands of pigs were also slaughtered under the pretense of confining swine flu. Naturally all were owned by Christians.

Consensus
With regard to your statement: """"Regarding the mediation, this would appear to be a situation of a few editors dissenting with a large consensus. Am I correct about that?"""" I think it's about right, but does need to be qualified. Some editors, like Matt Britt and Seraphimblade, still do strongly support the binary prefixes (but, to their credit, never edit warred over them). There was, however, an emerging consensus to allow the use of parenthetical disambiguation alongside legacy prefixes, as opposed to replacing them with binary prefixes. I'm convinced a workable solution can be devised if the edit warring stops. In my opinion, Sarenne's role in all this has been highly counterproductive, though I am also guilty to an extent for participating in an ongoing edit war. *** Crotalus *** """,0

Whoa.  I really lost you here.  The affine space was only an analogy.  I do not want to construct something new, only show that there are two classes in common usage: Clifford ring (my name) and Clifford algebra; furthermore, that some inaccuracy occurs because they are not adequately distinguished.  All I'm saying is that there exists a class of objects (Clifford ring) in which no specific subspace is necessarily known as the generating vector space V.  You can hide the identity of the subspace V (and the grading) by """"mysterious relabelling"""".  But here is the point: this relabelling truly does hide which of the basis vectors span V; it is possible to form a product for every element in the ring, but impossible to identify the original subspace V used in the construction.  The quaternions are a ring isomorphic to Cℓ0,2(ℝ), which has a 1,2,1 grading structure.  Yet, given ℍ, can you find a unique decomposition with this grading structure?  No.  In a CA, grading specifically refers to a unique/natural decomposition into (I think it is into a direct sum of) 0-vectors, 1-vectors, 2-vectors etc.  talkcontr 19:22""",0

Note that the power of such a demon would be two-fold: both empirical and rational thinking can be completely compromised. This leads to a worrisome argument:

In the same spirit of humour I'd like to quote PST out of contextPerhaps I should have framed my remark in a less confrontational manner, but at its present length, it will at least leave an indelible mark on the OP's mind, which, I hope, will help him/her to realize the meaning of my comment later on.
I intended no harm towards any of the people involved. Also noting from your talk page - I see DeclanDavis is suspicious of me now.

"Deleting Pop This Whole Place Open 

Excuse me, but what the fuck do you think you're doing? I posted a page on here for my band 'Pop This Whole Place Open' and you promptly deleted it. What is the meaning of this debauchery? Wikipedia is clearly a website used to provide information. What harm comes from posting a page about my band. It was completely truthful and I am just trying to make a name for myself. Who do you thin you are deleting this page? You go around judging people's contributions to other pages about popular subjects and that is perfectly fine, but who the fuck are you to tell me that the information that I posted about my own band isn't worthy of being on Wikipedia? Huh? Who would better be the authority on the subject than I. I ought to find you and expose my penis to you. You, asshole, are nothing but a whore. A whore who thinks they have some kind of say in the matters of life. What if we became famous? Then there would be a page on here about us and you wouldn't be deleting it. But since we are some band you've never heard of that makes it okay to delete our page. You must be some high authority in the music business that I don't know about. I must have insulted your intelligence by making a page which only I could possibly contain all the knowledge to. Regardless of the reason that you deleted my page, let me tell you something, Schmegma Von Dicksuckington, you can fuck yourself, long and hard, with a baseball bat covered in barbed wire.

"""POV ==

The comments at the end of the article violate the Wikipedia policies on NPOV and verifiability.  In particular:

""""But the party never succeeded in persuading many people that Communism was the answer to these problems."""" -
This statement implies that the CPA was trying to persuade people that Communism was the answer to issues of civil rights, etc.  I doubt that this is the case, and it is not supported by any source that I know of.

""""Against these achievements must be set the party's long history as an apologist for the Soviet Union."""" -
The word """"apologist"""" is highly pejorative, and has no place in an encyclopedia article.  For example, the article on the Liberal Party does not describe them as an apologist for the United States.  In addition, the CPA appears to have been critical of the Soviet Union starting in 1968 (23 years before its dissolution).  It would be reasonable to state that the CPA long supported the Soviet Union, but this would be misleading without mentioning that the party was later critical of the Soviet Union.

""""Disenchantment with the Soviet Union led most of the party's members to leave over time."""" -
There were many factors leading to declining membership, and some people even left due to the CPA's criticism of the Soviet Union.  Although it is likely that disenchantment with the Soviet Union was the primary cause, this statement should be more specific and supported by a source.

Giving positive and negative POV is different to NPOV.  The article should present facts without passing moral judgement.  On its own, listing the issues that the CPA campaigned on is not POV, because it does not pass moral judgement on whether these were good or bad (although the wording does tend to present these campaigns as positive).  However, using the wording """"Against these achievements must be set"""" turns the paragraph into an argument on the merits of the CPA, with the campaigns presented as something positive and support for the Soviet Union presented as something negative.
TABIf this material is included, it should be given in a separate paragraph and give a factual account of the CPA's history of support and criticism of the Soviet Union.

"Is Wikipedia broken? 

Hi Piotrus,
After reading your morsels of wisdom, I have a couple of questions/comments/rants for you. I have seen several times editors leaving WP claiming WP is/was broken beyond repair or something. I think such a claim is fundamentally wrong.

The way I see it, Wikipedia is a complex dynamical system, with rather nontrivial internal interactions of a huge number of contributors and bureaucrats.  Moreover, it is probably governed by certain laws under certain assumptions. There is a microscale (individual contributors editing certain articles), a mesoscale (groups of editors pushing their agenda in a group of articles) and a macroscale, the whole project evolving over years. On a microscale nothing matters. You, me can join, can leave Wikipedia, very few would even notice. In a matter of days, may be months names and contributions would be forgotten, the project would however survive. 

What is interesting to me is that your morsels capture certain dynamics on a mesoscale quite well. And that made me wonder if you can share your thoughts over the future dynamics of the whole project here. Not just some subproject, not just over the next few days, but the whole Wikipedia over years.

That brings me to the next question. How can one claim the system of Wikipedia is broken? Do they understand the dynamics of Wikipedia better than me so that they see something that defies/breaks some natural laws? I understand that they joined the project to help it achieve a certain goal (whatever they set in their mind) and after a failure to do so, they leave frustrated. But to claim Wikipedia is broken? Why? What do they see that I do not? To me it is akin to claiming that the nature is broken after seeing that foxes eat rabbits. What do you think about that? (  )",0

"""

Qwyrxian, let me attempt to point out the flaws of your response to my arguments set forth above: Yes, I'm a new editor, however, with all due respect, that has no bearing on your inclination to decide on behalf of all viewers what should be made available to them.

I very much understand the purpose of Wikipedia.  My assertion is NOT that the middle-finger incident should be included in the subject article (I started) because of news reports, as you contend.  If you will review the foregoing, the reason why I cited the news reports is because a flagrantly reckless comment was inserted that what is of issue now is not worthy of documenting when the exact opposite is true; the news reports is best evidence in that regard, and the person who said it is not worthy has only but his mouthan inferior source of 'evidence,' relatively speaking.  It is noteworthy, and, if you can come to appreciate the context of the subject's profession and for which has become known to be involved in, then you'll come to appreciate the significance it plays out in the essential need to properly reflect the entirety of the trial in which the subject became a major fixture as co-counsel.

Your example of everyday political speeches is seriously an aytypical example by which to convey your point:  Contrary to a mudane, everyday speech, here, an attorney just allegedly got out of court in obtaining a siginficant finding in his client's favordefeating immense odds and seemingly going against the court of public opinionand just afterwards gathered with his team at a restaurant just down the street from that historic victory, during which he released the manifestation of his emotions, etc., as one could imagine.  This was included as part of a segment of the whole article of the article-there is no article specifically on this incident, so let's also come to appreciate that.

And, to the contrary that this incident is of interest only at the moment, more and more discussions are being held about the audacious incident, and has cultivated an interest in what happens next, as if it is leading to a whole host of other actions (whether that includes the filing of a bar complaint, etc.), and this leads us to the national grand scale interest of the audacity of officers of courts acting in such a manner, etc.

Furthermore, I concede that Wikipedia is not in existence for the greater good, and that was never my contentio.  Again, you misunderstood the context I place in the words, """"public interests."""" Going back to the above, it is incontrovertible that is of the interests of the public, and, consequently, it should be documented well because, as noted in the latter paragraph, it is beginning to take shape in having a lasting impact on what we have come to expect from individuals, such as the subject of the article.

Let otherscertainly at least those who helped me in creating the articlechime in with their thoughts before you take an action on behalf everyone else.  Let's not do something in such a haphazard way.  Do not deny information in haste.   """,0
"Gwiazda (Polish for “Star”) was a weekly newspaper published in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in Polish from 1902 to 1985, with an English section gradually introduced, starting in 1958.

Now, as for my not having replied to every single one of your points, well yes, when you present me with a wall of text of that nature, brimming with implications and assumptions and accusations and who knows what, I will indeed pick out the specific points that spring to mind. I'm not here to write essays explaining things to you. And in fact, much of this discussion should be happening on the talk page of the article, not here. But, since the template I used invited you here, I will entertain your questions here for a little while.

First, I don't see any """"bizarre wall of steel"""" around Murphy's article. I see a single-purpose account (Orbiston) repeatedly and determinedly trying to insert negative material, and a small selection of other accounts and IP addresses (some of which were single purpose accounts, and some not) dealing with that. Orbiston was neither being """"reasonable"""", nor trying """"to do no more than mention SM's sexuality"""", nor was he willing to abide by Wikipedia's policies. That's why he got blocked - not """"aggressive censorship"""".

I haven't used the word """"conspiracy"""", so I have no idea where you got that from.

The Wikipedia page Stephen Fry mentions Fry's sexuality with due weight - I think one or two sentences out of a very lengthy article that has more than 150 references, as against 5 (currently) for the Murphy article. Also, Fry has publicly campaigned on gay rights and related issues - he deliberately makes it a part of his public persona and his internet fame. Murphy has not done so.

Now, imagining for a moment that your postulated scenario is correct, that the only reason that Murphy's sexuality was mentioned in published sources was that a """"disgusting tabloid exposé"""" was planned, then I don't need to explain to you that such material is not the sort of thing we use to evidence commentary about a living person on Wikipedia.

I'm making this reply on an """"I'm started so I'll finish"""" generosity basis, but really you have no right to make accusations of this nature, here or anywhere else. Don't do it, please.

As you are an investigative journalist, I recommend to you the website and forum http://wikipediocracy.com/ - that site has amongst its """"trustees"""" a number of individuals who consider themselves """"professional journalists"""" in the USA, and I am sure that many of them share similar concerns to yourself about places where young gay men can express their feelings.

Please don't make silly """"might be behind this aggressive censorship"""" accusations here again, or I'll have to remove them without comment. I really am quite busy.  (talk) """,0

 Recent revert 

I think some of this article is too """"flowery"""" and should just stick to the facts.  I have an issue with the following 

""""Should her appeal fail, her remaining hopes lie only with the British people and government, a nation in which many people oppose capital punishment.  If she is unsuccessful in canvassing support and overturning her conviction or being granted clemency, she faces execution by lethal injection.""""

I feel this should be simplified to:

""""If her appeal fails or if she is not granted clemency, she faces execution by lethal injection.""""

The details are as follows:

1. """"...her remaining hopes lie only with the British people and government..."""" - this overemphasizes the importance of Britich public opinion of the US judicial system.  It would be more appropriate to say here hopes rest on the Govenor of Texas or whoever it is who has the authority to grant clemancy as they are the people with the autority to free her

2. """"...a nation in which many people oppose capital punishment..."""" - POV and should be removed.  The statement could just as easily state that many people in the UK support capital punishment.  Here is a mori poll that claims that 70% support capital punishment http://www.beecareful.info/news/general/74447-channe-4-poll-reveals-70-per-cent-support-for-the-death-penalty.html.

3. """"...If she is unsuccessful in canvassing support and overturning her conviction or being granted clemency, she faces execution by lethal injection..."""" - stating the obvious - i.e. she is on death row so obviously if nothing changes, she will be executed.

About Korean language
Hi Chink, Well. it's well known that Wikiepdia is contaminated by many Chinese propagandists who spread lies. Chinese hate the term of Altaic since they has been conquered by Altaic people throughout history. Most of all, they want to cut any relation between Manchu and Korean as it's shown in their very political attempts in Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. They have good many reasons to make Korean as language isolate.

Anyway stepping off this kind of their political attempts. The notion that """"Most classify it as a language isolate while a few consider it to be in the Altaic language family"""" is wrong, no it's a fake. There are two references that chinks insists they support the notion, but there's no such phrases in the references.

Have you ever checked the reference? Or are you suffering from dyslexia? Where in the reference, Song, Jae Jung (2005) """"The Korean language: structure, use and context"""" Routledge, p. 15, can you find a phrase that make you tell """"Most classify it as a language isolate""""? and the same with """" a few consider it to be in the Altaic language family?""""

As in the reference, Song, Jae Jung (2005) """"The Korean language: structure, use and context"""" Routledge, p. 15, the author says """"While controvesial, Korean as Altaic is more accpeted as any other views"""".

The point I am trying to make is that the article Secunderabad discusses several aspects of Secunderabad and not just architecture. The number of pictures in each section should be proportionate to the length of that section. We have enough pictures for the section on architecture. A mention and description of important structures should suffice.
As for the other pictures you have pointed out. I beleive the picture of Garden restaurant has nothing to do with advertisement. The restaurant is a local landmark and is therefore of significance. Pictures of locally famous restaurants are often featured in wikipedia articles about cities. Refer Cafe du Monde picture in New Orleans. The Tankbund road picture is also significant. It is an important thoroughfare in the city which acts as the main arterial road that connects the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderaabd. As for the Parade Grounds picture, I'm not contesting its significance or insignificance. However it doesn't hurt to keep the picture. I hope I cleared things up a bit. Thanks",0

"I strongly disagree whith your opinion, but since I'm clearly outnumbered I'll accept your decision; in my opinion, the most information it's removed, the least useful this article becomes: the only “opening year” isn't really relevant, if it's taken individually - and despite being stable data, they're alike questionable (at least for early systems) - and this way even the sortability of the table   becomes pointless: it'll be more rational to revert the article to a mere, simple list as it was before March 2013 (if I correctly saw in the “history”). Conversely, the reader's usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwide/continental list: if you're interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial Wiki pages, while if you aim to a world overview, it's somewhat tiring to “search, open & match” a handful of different article. Don't take it to heart, but I don't intend to further contribute to this list: good luck with your project, but from my personal point of view as reader/user it doesn't worth the needed time and effort.",0

 revived / remains 

So:
 What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus """"second half of the 20th century"""", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, """"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies"""" or in English """"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades""""). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't """"remain"""" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing """"revived"""" the critical points in 1961.
 Where you perhaps have a point (with """"remains"""") is that Toumanoff's main point, the """"Bagratids argument"""", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).
 I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (""""revived... continue to maintain""""). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.
  
Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.   

Did you actually read Sarkissian's article? He quotes authors from 1920s and 1930s, and says: 

Such was, and to a large extent still is, the traditional view about the life and the work of Moses of Khoren which was accepted by the Armenians. It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.

So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master """,0

 Interaction Ban... not working 

I'm not waiting 8 hours, sorry. I don't know if that even applies to everyone or just to the editors under the ban, but I don't really care to be honest... this is out of hand. It's absolutely ridiculous what I-P is turning into on Wikipedia and it is largely a result of this interaction ban which is broken on a nearly daily basis. It is pitting the two """"sides"""" against each other and it has gotten worse than I have ever seen it. The interaction ban is not working; therefore, I hope that you will do something else that can help this situation before it completely falls apart. Here are the newest violations of the interaction ban:
I know you are already aware of the post that was made at AN/I. It had a direct mention of Mbz1 by Factomancer through diffs. It was not a complaint about an interaction ban violation on Mbz1's part, so there was no reason for Factomancer to be mentioning Mbz1. You responded at that AN/I and didn't do anything about it, so I guess you didn't consider it a violation for some reason. Maybe because she attempted to strike out and delete the request after the fact? Although personally that makes it worse in my eyes, but clearly I'm not the admin. 
Anyway, past AN/I, she put the same violation on her user page here . It is also a clear violation of WP:UP#POLEMIC. Soon after, she also removed this information, replacing the content with this  stating that she is going on a long break. She has done this before when she has gotten herself into big trouble, only to change her mind after a couple of days and come back. As we can see, her temporary break in that case didn't change her behaviour, as here we are once again.
I'm truly tired of dealing with this crap. Last year we actually had some sort of collaboration going on in I-P on Wikipedia, before we had to deal with issues like this (to this severity, at least). A combination of a few """"new"""" users coming into the I-P struggle relatively recently have turned it into a real warzone between the two sides, and I don't like it. I don't think other people like it either. It is having an EXTREMELY detrimental effect on the encyclopedia in the I-P area, because not only is so much of our time wasted fighting and defending each other in constant AE and AN/I reports, or sitting out short bans for minor infractions, but even aside from that, it just isn't rewarding or feasible to try to contribute and collaborate anymore. There is no longer an expectation that posting something constructive on a talk page will lead to discussion from people who disagree. There is no point of making significant edits to articles because they are simply followed up by quick reverts, often with no edit summary.
I was planning on coming up with some conclusion to this complaint to convince you to take action, but you know what, typically as of late I've even lost my motivation to do that. I just don't care; it's a waste of time and probably won't get the atmosphere between editors back to what it used to be anyway. The problem is that all you can do (or are willing to do anyway) is impose bans based strictly upon the word of the rules interpreted specifically based on the individual situation. If you took a minute to look at the big picture and understand the impact that certain users are having on the entire I-P editing community with their constant infractions and battles, maybe you would think of a different solution.

 Hypocritical editing by han/chinese user on East Turkestan Islamic Movement. 

Hello MS good day to you. Please take a look at the page. [] is always making unsubstantiated edits making it look like the ETIM freedom-fighters have been declared as terrorists even by countries and international agencies when they have not been in reality. The US had put them in the list of terrorist-organizations for a brief while before they removed the ETIM. More glaringly, he even lists the Central Asian countries including Afghanistan as """"opponents"""" of ETIM when in reality it is a problem for purely the han/chinese. As to whether it is an occupied nation like Tibet and Inner-Mongolia or not is besides the point. But these articles being passed off as references have NOTHING to do with the ETIM. They do not in anyway convey that the ETIM is being opposed by the countries that are being claimed there. Please take a look at this. It has been used as a proof of Afghanistan being an """"opponent"""" of the ETIM but the entire article saying naught of Uyghurs or East-Turkestan. Please do something. 117.194.231.8  """,0

"Don´t hide correct information, instead help people get access to it 

Hi Tournesol, Wikipedia have never been about consensus. Wikipedia is about making new correct and useful information public for a brooder amount of people quicker and within a shorter time interval than ordinary dictionaries.
This means researchers with a specific knowledge may help other people get access to it and speedup the expansion of the world mainstream knowledge. I think you agree It´s a god deed to share information even if this knowledge is regarded new for the ordinary layman and in the forefront of science.
Wikipedia has never been about satisfying some perverse peoples needs to act as deputies for bureaucratic hegemonies. 
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And do you Tournesol really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?",0

For about a thousand years, the only form of Christianity was Roman Catholicism. The article on Christianity mentions the Protestant/Catholic schism in the lede. However: it does NOT state that some in each camp did not recognize the other as Christianand in fact some of that still holds sway today, e.g. the anti-Catholic Jack Chick tracts. So we have the idea of historically something has been, but does not state that those adherents do not usually recognize the other side as being part of them. The upshot: Argument from Antiquity is a fallacy no matter how you try to word it. Same with Argument from Numbers.

We could also look at the page on atheism. Nowhere in that lede does it talk about communism (as many people still equate atheism with communism) or wickedness (as even some dictionaries include that in the definition of atheism).

 Response to the lies in your RFC TAB 

HiTAB 

I posted this response to your RFC on Canaen.TAB I believe you removed it.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way.TAB 

The funniest thing for me is that you are busy digging a hole in your own canoe because your allegations are lies. You are entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant.TAB 
You are an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement. You have been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or these other individuals and yet you not only continue to go on making such allegations but you even use them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.TAB 
Don't worry, Karma will come and get you in its own time.TAB 
 TAB 
 ==User conduct RFC==TAB 

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you. It can be found  here. Cheers,  TAB 

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.TAB 

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity.TAB 
 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods.TAB 
I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine.TAB

-TAB:For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff.TAB 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.TAB

"I have no idea why you are posting the slang definitions of 'fuck'.  That is a total non-sequitur.  I have not seen anyone here assert that there aren't any ways of using 'fuck' that are slang.  The point was, and remains, that the standard use of the word 'fuck' as both a noun and a verb - the only ways that this word has been used in this entire discussion throughout this entire week up until your latest post - has been the standard definition that is widely understood and accepted as a normal word that is nowhere near slang.

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

As for the meta-discussion (the discussion about the discussion), Andy's revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted.  And where did he choose to raise that discussion?  Over on my User Talk page.  That is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion.  I suggested to him that the discussion be moved here.  Instead he moved it to an Admin page where he called for me to be blocked.  Is that the action of anyone who wants rational discussion?

Political comments on ancient times articles
While it's good that you want to prevent disruption to articles, I would thank you to please not use the talk pages of ancient times stuff to discuss contemporany political stuff as you did on Talk:Alexander the Great. See the WP:TALK wikipedia style guideline on commenting on talk pages   

The point was to address the recurring references that suggest """"Macedonia wasn't Greek"""" in the Alexander Talk pages. Clearly their intent is political in nature and some sort of disclaimer seemed in order to prevent unauthentic contributions. 

Although I disagree with your choice to completely remove a disclaimer in the Alexander talk page (not the main article) as I mentioned in your own talk page I will accept the removal( since I'm new here and bow to your wisdom). I only ask that you please consider my concerns that the talk page is heavily politicized already.

  

You are right that the talk page can get very politized (it changes with time as old discussions get archived, and new discussions get opened). A warning (not a disclaimer) could be good, but it ought to be at the top of the page (with the other boxes at the top of the talk page) and be very short and neutral, and its rationale should rely on historical sources for ancient times, and not on the current political situation. Sorry for taking so long, but I had stuff to do outside of wikipedia.   

Would it be possible for you to add the warning Enric? This way if could be done to your own satisfaction?  

I made a short warning. It's all I could think of. I copied the code from Talk:Homeopathy.

RE: Four years later, Einhorn was involved in a more genuine controversy with the producers of Nancy McClernan's play Tam Lin, which resulted in legal action.[8]

The controversy began when Edward Einhorn registered a  derivative copyright on what he called a """"blocking and choreography"""" script, completely without my authorization after he had a fee dispute with my production partner. A year later, when I produced my play TAM LIN he sued me on the basis that I was violating his (unauthorized derivative) copyright.

In the past there was no such nation as """"Germany"""". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as """"Brandenburg"""", """"Saxony"""", """"Hanover"""" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like """"Hanoverian"""" and """"Bavarian"""" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just """"German"""" or """"Deutsch"""". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture """"Bavarian"""" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name """"Macedonia"""", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein""",0

"The myth that Robert the Bruce offered safe haven to the Templars has also crept back in.  In fact, the most that can truthfully be said about that is that Robert I perhaps didn't prosecute the Templars with a lot of vigor.  All that business about hundreds of French Templars escaping to Scotland and assisting Robert the Bruce's armies, etc. is actually relatively modern mythology.  The reality was that there was only a handful of Templars in Scotland at the time the Order was dissolved, and Robert I was not about to risk further papal censure by interfering.  He intended all along to eventually get back into the church's good graces, and did so, being reinstated, with his excommunication being lifted, in 1328. 66.156.107.108",0

 Acceptance of reposted article 

I see that you accepted a draft article on Jason Binn. When you did so, presumably you were aware that an article by the same title had previously been deleted as a result of an AfD discussion. (If you weren't, then I suggest in future you should check for any deletion log for any article before you create it.) Even without any previous deletion history, I would have found your acceptance of the draft open to question, as it was distinctly promotional in tone, and its sourcing was largely to sources which were not independent (e.g. his own magazine, a press release, etc) or did not give substantial coverage of him.

 """"Jesus and Messianic prophecy"""" 

Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

are they important economically? - they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia. I don't have figures for what % of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need?- variable - there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation. Some species only occur in Peatswamps, other in poor sand soils i.e. heath forests, others on rich clay soils.
what animals eat their seeds? - when they fruit, which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x (2-16) years in some of the Borneo species - they are an important food source.

 Imdb forum/messageboard  access now requires creditcard verification or Amazon purchase 

Credit card verification,Amazone acct. and purchase from Amazon within one year.  Ridiculous.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

That is not actually true. There are several options available. Although I don't think there are any free options, I know an Amazon account is not the only one.    

If you do NOT KNOW then why are you questioning it. I have seen it first hand.  I just got a screen when registering that asked for all that information.  Asked for a purchase from 1 years time.  Do not delete my edits. I sense astroturfing here.  Censorship.

 I've been using the IMDb for years but to investigate this claim I just connected as a brand new user. First, the message boards are still free. Anyone can read them, you don't even need to register as a user. When you do register you need to authenticate your registration before you can write a message to the message boards. But this is free as well. You can do it by giving the details of an Amazon account where you've made a purchase - at any time, not just in the last year. Or you can give your credit card details, no charge is made on that credit card, they just verify the card. Or you can have the system send an SMS text message (not a premium rate message) to your mobile phone. None of these authentications need cost you any money to authenticate your account but they let the IMDb tie the account to a real person. They give quite valid reasons why they consider this to be necessary    

 :: I placed a citation template so we can avoid an Edit war. You need to calm yourself and discuss this in a civilized manner. The Pro interface and other industry accesses can be used instead of Amazon which is what I was referring to. They are not free which is why I said I didn't know if there where any free options available. I believe what  said above shows that free access is still available though and should be reflected in the article.   

 Yup, no evidence that anything on the non-pro side of the IMDB isn't free. All evidence says it's still free. Verification isn't the same as a charge, it's still free. If you can provide evidence that you've had to pay for IMDB message board access then please show.  talk 

 How does it make sense to say that you need to purchase from Amazon to post a message and call it FREE.  What does the term free mean to you? Also doesn't it strike you as coniving and exploitative that they would ask for credit cards to post on a messageboard.

On Makemi’s previous comment
Makemi said """"I'm not clear on how this is revolutionary, it seems like a bigger/faster/louder computer piano.""""

I deleted the remark on the CEUS being a milestone. I even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise. Despite the fact that even the praises I made were based on facts, on the quest that has been going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the full gamut of expressiveness of the best performers at the piano.

So here is the current article that I have, incorporating the recent change I made, following Makemi’s feedback. Any praise of any kind has been deleted by me (even though my praises were based on facts, on knowledge).

The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
Pianos That Has For goal of Accomplishing Full Expressiveness at the Keyboard==
During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.

The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.

Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.
At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.

Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be.

"The solution without a reference 

  //  Y1+
  //  =/=N0      
 M1

N0 never produces an output. The algorithm always produces a “M1” result when the answer is “Yes” from the oracle queried, and never produces a result when the answer is “N0” even to the other possible phrasings of the same query. It is striking how easy it is to miss the ingenuity of our programmers here. Most of the solution was already present as much as the pioneers and experts in the field surmised and asserted possible. Particularly, the comment on Fermat’s Last Theorem is relevantly applicable, such deep theories are in many instances required to solve largely thought unsolvable problems, especially in cases when most of the solution and the proof in the word was already known to the experts in the field.

The algorithm answers “Yes” with “M1” when the output produced from a correctly asked question produces never a “No” (written as N0) result, but only a “Yes” result. Incorrectly stated questions are they that cannot be resolved because they result in a “N” or “No” output never producing m by the computer given an incorrectly asked question. Given a correctly asked question, the computer will always return a “M” output eventually. But given the complexity of the question and the known variables the time required to solve an NP-Complete problem depends entirely on the specific incidence and construction of this algorithm. To illustrate the functions here is a clear example:

Question correctly asked: “Does the remote control not need new batteries?”

ALGORITHM says check the button function, if it changes the channel on the TV or the volume of the TV the computer monitoring the remote control produces a “M” result. The conclusion is output: Yes means no.

Incorrectly asked question seeking an NP-Complete problem: “Does the remote control have new batteries?” 

If the check of the remote control does reveal a failure of the button to change the channel or volume of the TV the answer is the conclusion is never output because this would be a “No” or “N” response.50.20.186.81  I Jesus, leave it as a proof to all life.

"Could someone please make the discussion about comparing medical vs. veterinary school admissions more concise?  I have lived in two states, Michigan, and California.

Observe:

A=B.

Multiply both sides by A and you get:

A2=AB.

Add A2 to both sides to get:

A2+A2=A2+AB.

Using addition we get:

2A2=A2+AB.

Subtract 2AB from both sides:

2A2-2AB=A2+AB-2AB.

Thus:

2A2-2AB=A2-AB.

Combining terms on the LHS:

2(A2-AB)= A2-AB.

Divide both sides by  (A2-AB):

2(A2-AB)/(A2-AB)= (A2-AB)/(A2-AB).

Cancel out like terms and Viola!  We now see:

I'd suggest splitting the lead into two paragraphs for readabilityperhaps at """"Increased expenses and decreasing ridership""""?
""""with two railroad stations in operation, one on the C&O; line and the Union Station just west of the C&O; station at the junction between the C&O; and Southern railroads""""  I found this part of the sentence hard to follow at first glance; maybe break this off as a second sentence: """"two railroad stations in operation. One was on the C&O; line, and the second, the Union Station, was just west..."""" Am I understanding the meaning correctly in this rewrite?
""""Development of the streetcar system""""  I'd suggest breaking this long paragraph into at least two for readability (Perhaps at """"this continued until..."""")
Route Description  split large paragraph for readability
Two statements here that it would be better to fix in time per WP:REALTIME for clarity in the long-term:

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

Fowler&fowler; has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment. 
Nichalp says in the present thread """"The term """"British India"""" is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India"""". I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.
On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. 
Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. 
In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  
One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?

In addition to a pretermination (Loudermill) hearing, an employee must be afforded a full evidentiary hearing, after the termination takes effect.[2] However, the scope of the pretermination hearing depends upon the scope of the post-termination hearing available to the employee. If a full post-termination hearing is available, the Loudermill pretermination hearing is minimal.

In such situations the employee would have an opportunity to respond in the pretermination hearing as long as she had available a post-termination hearing. Thus, the pre-termination hearing functions as """"an initial check against mistaken decision  essentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.""""[3] If a pretermination hearing is """"oral or written notice of the charges against [the employee], an explanation of the employer's evidence [against the employee], and an opportunity [for the employee] to present their side of the story.""""[4]

The final sentence makes no sense, as it is not a complete sentence.

"""POV fix ==

I removed text that claimed that most liberals claim the posting of the commandments on a government building violated the """"separation of church and state"""" (and the statement that """"separation of church and state is not part of the constitution"""" or whatever it was) and replaced it with """"liberals oppose the posting of the Ten Commandments on public property, arguing that it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."""" and I wikified the link to the first amendment.

While posting the ten commandments is not literally """"making a law"""" establishing a state religion, it could create a """"slippery slope"""" situation that eventually entangles government in religion to a degree that the establishment clause is more likely to be violated.  It is a rational position to presume that it is safer for the constitution for the government to """"avoid the appearence"""" of impropriety by not posting religious symbols.  I wonder how many Christian or Jewish groups would like to walk past a Ganesh or Buddha statue whenever they go to court?  Probably they wouldn't.  Religious neutrality is a critical element of American civil society, and reflects the reality of pluralistic religious faith.  By acknowledging none, the government is actually honoring all of them and the beliefs of every American as equal.  

It would also violate the Equal Protection clause for the religious beliefs of any citizen, including a belief that the ten commandments were of divine origin, or that the clearly religious commandments must be upheld to avoid angering a god, to be sponsored by the government by posting them as they commonly are on government buildings.

These positions better reflect the normative liberal view of the establishment clause, and I will see if it is possible to work them into the article as a description of these philosophies, without promoting them.  Understanding positions that are contrary to your own can be an important source of personal intellectual growth.

I also explained the conservative/religious view of the posting a bit better, and deleted the reference to the Dershowitz article because 1) it was totally irrelevant (about same sex marriage, not posting the ten commandments), and 2)the editor who referenced it to support his POV argument that liberals only favor a separation of church and state when it suits their purposes either deliberately or accidently misunderstood Dershowitz's point.  Dershowitz was arguing that government should be less entangled in deciding who could get married than it is now, and leave it to the individual religious to decide what marriages are acceptable.  This would promote the separation of church and state, not undermine it.  Because it was both POV, and reflected confused thinking, not to mention totally irrelevant, I simply removed it rather than trying to fix it.

 Wikipedia inclusion guidelines 

Hi Florenta. Whilst I recognise that you are trying to do something nice for your friend by including him in Wikipedia, please be aware that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. We have guidelines and policies regarding what can and cannot be included; the most important of these is that subjects must be notable. For a simple explanation, see this page.

Dan Lake does not appear to meet the criteria for notability (he has not been the subject of substantial coverage in multiple, independent, reliably published sources) and so is not a suitable subject for inclusion here. There are, however, many aother websites which you might like to consider submitting to instead.  雲‍水 """,0

What do you call everything you do FeloniousMonk? That is, if it's not a political campaign on your part, what is? The POV campaigning I see here is a radical left-wing campaign on your part. My only goal is to bring things into balance here on Wikipedia because most outsiders regard it as highly unreliable and biased. Why don't readers have the right to know the type of group CRESP is ideologically speaking and who they associate with?

What's the problem with showing the political biases of groups you support, say compared with your baseless accusation that people like Paul Weyrich or James Dobson want to impose Old Testament law upon the United States? I thought that if something was factual and verifiable, it was kosher. That's what you told me about TheocracyWatch. If Paul's a theocrat, then maybe you could find a first-hand reference of the kind I provided. Are you not aware that United for Peace and Justice was founded by the Communist Party USA and a number of Marxist groups, and according  to the Commmunist Party USA Web site Joelle Fishman an officer of the CPUSA is a member of the steering committee? Tell me, why are you so worried about people knowing that CRESP belongs to an organization populated by the Ruckus Society, CodePink and the Communist Party USA?
The vast majority of the UNFPJ's members are pretty extreme on the Left side of the spectrum. The important thing about UNFPJ is who founded it.
For me to a belong to a group on the right akin to the UNFPJ, it would be akin to belonging to a group founded or run by the Nazis. Are you afraid of the truth?

Deal with the substance here, not my personality, or your efforts to railroad me with a phony RfC signed by your friends. Let's stop applying the rules differently when they make you uncomfortable. 

Why is it poisoning the well to point out the fact CRESP is involved with a pretty radical group? Are you afraid of the truth? NPOV doesn't mean just FeloniousMonk's point of view. I'm for balance, and diversity of opinions, expressed fairly is a good idea, don't you think?

TheocracyWatch can't prove it's claims, but I can prove these.
 
There's nothing for me to learn from the RfC except some people are afraid of having their worldviews challenged, or from being restrained from pressing their anti-religious political agendas. If you don't like my """"POV campaigning,"""" then why do you do it yourself? 

What do you call your series of hit pieces on the Christian Right about the supposed threat of """"Dominionism,"""" if it's not POV campaigning? Why is it every article you have posted on politics or religion expresses a Left of center POV? If I missed one, show me. I guess that's not POV campaigning, right?

Just in case you hadn't noticed, 49 of the 50 states say God is the ultimate authority, and it's spelled out in their constitutions.

How is expressing a more neutral perspective that is closer to the center of the political spectrum a threat to Wikipedia? What makes your POV superior to mine?  """,0

"I deeply apologize for overlooking your last two messages of Jan 3 until today.  I'm still new at this and I simply didn't see them, although I certainly should have.

Anyway, your pictures of the Richards building are great!  Some of them, such as the full-height shots of the western service tower and the two towers flanking the main entrance, aren't available anywhere else as far as I know. The porch photos certainly help to illustrate the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor.  This collection of photos will benefit anyone who is studying what is generally considered to be Kahn's breakthrough work.  If you don't mind, I might make minor changes to some of the descriptions.  In particular, you correctly identified the two types of shafts in the photo taken from the garden on the south side, so I would remove the question marks from that description.

If you ever get a chance to visit the Olivetti-Underwood Factory building near Harrisburg, that would be great, especially since that article doesn't have any photos at all.  I suspect, however, that the building will be difficult to photograph.  The standard books on Kahn's work usually include a shot of one of its 72 mushroom-shaped (more-or-less) structural units while it was under construction, one of the entire building taken at an angle from an airplane, and one of the old entrance that was apparently at the northeast corner.  The old entrance seems to have been closed, so from the ground on the outside, options today seem to be limited.  

It still might be possible, however, to take a photo that gives viewers a feel for the size and shape of one of those 72 mushroom units, which would be very helpful.  When I follow the link in that article to the aerial photo of the building, I see that those units might be most visible and accessible from the west side, so perhaps a meaningful photo could be taken of the mushroom unit in the northwest corner of the building.  You would want to emphasize the west side of that mushroom unit, which has an indentation separating it from the next unit to the south, which should help to visualize its shape.  The north side of that mushroom has a triangular protrusion between it and the next mushroom to the east, which I suspect would obscure its shape.  Frankly, I'm not sure how well this will work from the ground, but it is worth a try.  Depending on the light, it might work better to try a similar photo of the mushroom unit on the northeast side of the building, where I think the old entrance used to be, again de-emphasizing the protruding triangle on the east side if possible.

Also, perhaps there is a visitor's area in the entrance lobby where photos of the internal structure of that mushroom unit are permitted?

Good luck, and thanks again.",0

"""== Forbes Magazine's """"Most Powerful"""" Ranking ==

There is an increasing number of Forbes Magazine references appearing in the leading paragraphs of biographical wiki pages.  The opening paragraphs of a wiki page should contain important details, not subjective trivia.  Forbes 'most powerful' ranking is merely one American magazine editor's perceived and unsupported opinion as to each well-known person's 'power'.  By rights it should not appear on any wiki page other than the Forbes magazine page or Forbes Magazine ranking page.
It appears the less powerful an important person or celebrity is, the more likely (s)he is to have a Forbes ranking on their wiki page.  Truly powerful people do not.  For example:
Barack Obama (President, USA) - No mention of Forbes ridiculous ranking on his page
Vladimir Putin (Prime Minister, Russia) - No mention of Forbes
Dmitry Medvedev (President, Russia) - No mention of Forbes
David Cameron (Prime Minister, United Kingdom) - No mention of Forbes
Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister, Israel) - No mention of Forbes
Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King, Saudi Arabia) - No mention of Forbes
Nicolas Sarkozy (President, France) - No mention of Forbes
Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader, Iran) - No mention of Forbes
Naoto Kan (Prime Minister, Japan) - No mention of Forbes
Ashfaq Parvez Kayani (Chief of Army Staff, Pakistan) - No mention of Forbes
So why do the Forbes rankings keep appearing all over wiki?  Is there a wiki rule to stop the magazine from obtaining free advertising at wiki's expense?
  
Sorry but what does this have to do with the main page? (Also while I have no opinion on whether Forbes ratings belong it hardly seems surprising that the less 'powerful' and important person or celebrity is, the more likely they are to have a Forbes rating. You don't need a Forbes rating to tell you Barack Obama is important. You just need to words, 'President of the United States'. The same with all the rest you mentioned.)   

Why do Forbes Magazine's unsubstantiated rankings garner support on wiki?  They are obviously fabricated.  Many are rubbish.  For example, Forbes rank Michelle Obama as the most powerful woman in the world.  Yet it is Barack who is the president, not Michelle.  As 'First Lady' Michelle has no power whatsoever.
How about the number 2 'ranked' woman?  It is an American food saleswoman (Irene Rosenfeld).  What complete baloney.  Number 3 is an American television host (Oprah Winfrey), and finally at number 4 is a woman with real power, the Chancellor of Germany (Angela Merkel).  Forbes incredibly has ranked an American grocer and an American television host above a head of government.
My question is, why does a supposedly factual encyclopaedia (wiki) rate worthy of mention the suppositions and meanderings of a magazine that specialises in listening to gossip rather than in researching facts?
  

So what does this have to do with the main page?
If you don't think the information belongs in articles the place to discuss that is on the talk page of the effected articles.  You could also be bold and remove it and explain why.  If another editor reverts you then you are into the bold, revert, discuss cycle and you know who to discuss it with.
The discussion does not belong here because it has nothing to do with the main page and that is what this page is for.   fan ~~ 
And if you do want discussion somewhere in a more centralised page, the big header has suggestions. Perhaps start at WP:VPP

so far...

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

"response re: deleted article in foreign language
Dear User RHaworth, thank you for your guidance.
I don't mind you delete my contributions. I am sorry you see them as adding clutter and redundency...
Since you are kind enough to correct my work, can you please give me a hint as to how I can create links from en.wikipedia.org to bg.wikipedia.org? or are those 2 completely different systems? I see dead links on my page even though I spent time to study how to create links.  18:30, 4 January 2007 (Kyoto, Japan)

response re: images
I appreciate your concern (and your humor). Initially, I was not able to avoid the automatic 'speedy deletion' of the uploaded image of Florica Musicescu, in spite of an explanation and request for a fair use review & advice... I found this very cruel. So I was forced to upload these images as 'public domain'. The origin of these images is Prof. Svela Protich, whom I know well in person. These are rare photographs of Prof. Protich's teachers- 'one of a kind'- and Prof. Protich determined it's necessary to add them to Wikipedia, for educational and non-profit purposes. However they are NOT to be used for any commercial purposes.

Since you have kindly critiqued my work, which I appreciate greatly, perhaps you can also support me to place the images into the right category (for fair non-profit use) without them getting deleted by the system... I would really appreciate it. MikiMilano  18:31, 4 January 2007 (Kyoto, Japan)",0

Agree with Quiddity on both need for and choice of image for the lead.  Fully support expanding summary, but not by directly repeating content in the article.  Blackash, the page has not been vandalized.  With the exception of deleting a single reference that was neither intelligible nor functional, I was careful to keep all references both intact and with the statements they referenced.  If I missed any, it was unintentional.  If I somehow misconstrued their proper location, please set that right without adding back repetitive material.  I DID remove a LOT of repetitive material, particularly the direct repetition in the lead of two paragraphs from the article.  That's not summarizing. . I reorganized and consolidated a number of verbose, clunky, and grammatically incorrect sentences and paragraphs, in several sections, into concise statements and ideas that flow from one to the next, hopefully building and conveying the idea smoothly.  Word count is not a measure of informative content.  It's supposed to be a concise encyclopedic article about arborsculpture, now being referred to by consensus (this I assume) as tree shaping.  It's not a book. It's not supposed to be a how-to manual.  It's not """"battle of the sculptors and the finer fractional points of their methods,"""" nor is it a debate on whose artistic technique is more pure, nor whose book is more popular or true, nor who sells more mirrors.  I strove for neutrality, well aware of the ongoing editing issues among the (IMO) way-too-involved author/editor/artist/arborists who currently monitor this page.  For just a single sticky example, waxing on about one's own (or someone elses) worldwide acclaim is not only not encyclopedic, it's unseemly.  It is made immeasurably more so by adding copious and ever-more-poorly formatted references to the insisted acclaim.  Further, there are several sections I haven't yet hammered at, that need it.  Most particularly the protracted sections comparing arborsculpture to (and from this reader's perspective, defending it from encroachment by) each and every other horticultural art & practice.  These sorts of writing read tensely and uncomfortably, like an argument, detracting from the fascinating topic. There may indeed be too many images for the text. Perhaps one exemplary image per artist is enough after all. ;)   """,0

"Gsd2000, I saw the comments by Rjensen and GraemeLeggett, and if it will help, I am sorry if it appeared as though I was falsly accusing you of solely advocating the position on Rockall. However, my statement was not only on Rockall, but the article in general including the map and your position that we need to copy the style of academic literature. Read it again and point out where I mention Rockall. I simply pointed out the fallacy in your argument for excluding Rockall (which from 1955 to 1972 was a possession and not anything like a county Sussex) and that your example again indicates overall how you would wish the article written.

As for Rjensen's comments, maybe he should then explain the various uninhabitable rocks possessed by Australia, the United Kingdom, and in particular the United States (e.g. Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Rockall, Baker Island, Howland Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island and all the other United States Minor Outlying Islands). Empire does not only deal with people and governments it also deals with territory and the status of the territory in relation to the possessing country.

Guinnog, as I said before, this stuff is really not worth starting an edit war over. If Gsd2000 wants the article a certain way and others support him, then they have every write to edit the article. Of course, considering that they can hardly answer any questions or points we may bring up (or maybe they just ignore them) nor actually give definitions to what constitutes kosher imperialism, trivialities etc then we should bring this debate to some forum or bringing in an admin (although by Gsd2000's comments he (or she) seems to be or thinks he (or she) is admin).

 Wikipedia Neutrality & This Biography Page 

I think it is fairly obvious by now, looking at the enormous amount of commentary over minutia detail over the last few weeks here on Deepak's page, that there is a handful group of editors posting and editing Deepak Chopra's biography here that belong to the Skeptics society and/or are well known Guerilla Skeptics (who have  published videos of their Guerilla tactics on Youtube).  I would not be surprised if some of them are getting well paid for their work.  Their willingness to go to any lengths to ban, harass, or IMO wear-out other contributing editors (who disagree with their view points) and willingness to use whatever tactics they can to promote their Skeptics society Point-of-View of credible scientists like Deepak or Rupert Sheldrake, or Frederic Myers, or Ian Stevenson or even William James, all of which the biographies here on Wikipedia have been modified in a very POV slanted manner (by many of these same small group of editors, sometimes in a very insidious labeling manner, such as calling Deepak Chopra a new-age Guru, or mentioning early on that Ian Stevenson was a """"gullible individual"""" etc.  I really do wonder how Wikipedia can continue to maintain there is any kind of veridical neutrality being practiced here?

I think it would be a good idea to bring in a whole new set of editors (or only allow a new set of editors) come in and rework some of the pages I have mentioned above, without the involvement of the Guerilla Skeptics here.  Perhaps a set of well-known editors that have established themselves on Wikipedia now for many years - could come in, and provide a fair and balanced approach to the biographies of Deepak Chopra, or Rupert Sheldrake, or Ian Stevenson etc.  None of which will be achieved IMO given the obvious agenda that has the foot prints - again of these few, extremely biased and active editors here. 159.118.158.122  """,0
